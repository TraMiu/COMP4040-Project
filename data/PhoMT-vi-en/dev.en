Hurricane Dorian, one of the most powerful storms ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, made landfall as a Category 5 storm on Great Abaco Island in the northern Bahamas on Sunday morning, September 1, 2019.
Dorian is especially dangerous due to its slow movement, high wind speeds, and heavy rains.
The storm passed by the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands as a tropical storm with little or no reported damage.
The United States branch office continues to gather information while monitoring the storm's impact on our brothers and also on branch - owned properties.
At this time, there have been no reported injuries among the 46 publishers in the two congregations on Great Abaco Island.
However, the only Kingdom Hall on the island was destroyed.
On Grand Bahama Island, there are four congregations and 364 publishers.
Initial reports indicate that 196 of our brothers are displaced and 22 homes have sustained damage.
Three homes have been destroyed.
The branch provided instruction in advance of the storm to local circuit overseers and elders in the affected areas.
The branch recommended that all the brothers relocate to the capital city of Nassau or other sheltered areas.
We pray for our brothers and sisters who are suffering as a result of this hurricane.
We know that Jehovah sees their difficulty and will continue to give them strength to cope with this time of distress.
Several Studies Show Oceans Face Serious Threats
The world's oceans are sick, and getting sicker every day.
Two new studies show the warming of Earth's atmosphere is removing oxygen from ocean waters and harming coral reefs.
Oxygen is necessary for all life in the oceans, except for a few extremely small organisms.
And researchers said oxygen levels are low enough to threaten all the ocean life that depends on it.
Denise Breitburg is an ocean scientist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center.
She is also a member of the Global Ocean Oxygen Network, a team of scientists organized by the United Nations to study the issue.
Breitburg told the Associated Press, "If you ca n't breathe, nothing else matters.
That pretty much describes it.
The journal Science published the two studies.
The first describes how the growing problem of falling oxygen levels is more complex than experts had thought.
The second study shows that rising ocean temperatures are greatly increasing coral reef bleaching events.
Vietnam clamped down on basic rights, including freedoms of speech, opinion, press, association, and religion.
Pro-democracy activists and bloggers faced constant harassment and intimidation.
Physical assaults on critics increased.
The National Assembly passed a revised penal code widening the basis for criminal conviction of bloggers and rights activists.
Farmers continued to lose land to development projects without adequate compensation, and workers were not allowed to form independent unions.
Independent home churches and religious groups were not permitted to operate.
"Vietnam tried to minimize political trials and convictions in 2015 to gain favor during the Trans - Pacific Partnership negotiations, but repression against activists remained firm, with beatings increasing," said Brad Adams, Asia director.
In November, Police General Tran Dai Quang publicly admitted that within the last three years the government had "received, arrested, and dealt with cases involving 2,680 people who violated national security" and noted that "opposition persons" had illegally established more than 60 human rights and democracy groups.
Those arrested in 2015 include a range of advocates for peaceful causes, ranging from environmentalism to political pluralism.
In April, the authorities arrested Nguyen Viet Dung for participating in a "pro-tree" peaceful march at Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi and charged him with disrupting public order under article 245 of the penal code.
In September, police in Thai Binh province arrested former political prisoner Tran Anh Kim for "activities aiming to overthrow the people's administration" under penal code article 79 because of his alleged establishment of a pro-democracy group.
In December, the police arrested prominent rights campaigner Nguyen Van Dai and charged him with "conducting propaganda against the state" according to article 88 of the penal code.
His fellow activist Le Thu Ha was also arrested.
With the spotlight on labor rights in the TPP negotiations, in June 2014, Vietnam released labor activist, Do Thi Minh Hanh, who was arrested and charged in 2010 under article 89 of the 2009 penal code for helping to organize a wildcat strike.
Other labor activists, including Nguyen Hoang Quoc Hung and Doan Huy Chuong, continued to serve harsh prison sentences.
In November 2015, the police of Dong Nai province detained and assaulted Do Thi Minh Hanh for helping workers at Yupoong Company exercise their rights.
In 2015, at least 45 bloggers and rights activists were beaten by plainclothes agents.
No one involved in the assaults was held accountable.
"As part of an international public relations campaign, the government appears to have changed tactics by arresting fewer critics and replacing prison with beatings," said Adams.
"A change from imprisonment to physical assault can hardly be called an improvement."
Human Rights Watch welcomed new laws to legalize sex reassignment surgery and gender recognition for transgender people who have undergone such surgery.
A provision in the revised criminal procedure code that will allow suspects to refuse to make statements against themselves was also passed by the National Assembly in November 2015.
Other positive developments include required recording of interrogations on video and the elimination of the requirement of lawyers to obtain certificate of defender for every single case they defend.
"Le Dinh Luong's 20 - year sentence is one of the harshest in the government's crackdown on peaceful activists," said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director.
"This is an opportunity for the court to right this wrong, distinguish between criticism of the government and actual threats to national security, and defend everyone's right to free expression."
The government arrested Le Dinh Luong, 53, in July 2017 and charged him with "carrying out activities that aim to overthrow the people's administration" under article 79 of the 1999 Penal Code.
The People's Court of Nghe An province originally scheduled Luong's trial for July 30, 2018, but postponed the hearing at the last minute.
Though the trial was supposed to be open to the public, only Le Dinh Luong's wife and younger brother were allowed into the courtroom.Foreign diplomats who tried to attend were barred.
On August 16, the People's Court convicted him and gave him an extraordinarily long prison sentence of 20 years, to be followed by an additional five years of probation with severe restrictions on his movements.
In an unusual move, the court imposed a longer sentence than the 17 years the Nghe An prosecutors office recommended.
Le Dinh Luong has participated in various activities that the Vietnamese authorities consider politically unacceptable, including religious and environmental protests.
He has joined various environmental demonstrations, including against Formosa Ha Tinh Steel, a Taiwanese company that has dumped toxic waste in the ocean and polluted Vietnam's central coast, causing massive fish deaths and an environmental disaster.
Police and army newspapers repeatedly accused Le Dinh Luong of being a "dangerous reactionary" connected to the Viet Tan, a US - based political party.
His case has raised many fair trial concerns.
In August 2017, the police rejected a request to have Ha Huy Son serve as Le Dinh Luong's defense lawyer.
The police claimed that a person suspected of serious national security violations would not be allowed to have a lawyer until the investigation was completed under then - article 58 (now article 74) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
He was not given permission to be represented by defense lawyers until early July.
On July 17, his daughter - in - law, Nguyen Thi Xoan, told a reporter forDefend the Defendersthat the family had been given no information about him since his arrest.
Freedom of expression and the right to be represented by counsel are guaranteed by the Vietnamese Constitution, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Vietnam is a party.
The appeals court should immediately release Luong and other activists who have been wrongly imprisoned and allow them to peacefully express their views.
The US State Department, the European Union, and various non-governmental organizations have urged the Vietnamese government to ensure that Le Dinh Luong and other human rights defenders obtain a fair trial as guaranteed by Vietnamese and international law.
"A 20 - year prison sentence for peaceful protest is outrageous," Robertson said.
"It should not matter if someone is protesting in favor or against the government's preferred position.
Vietnam's actions, in this case, will show its real attitude toward the rule of law.
Russian authorities are moving forward in their efforts to seize properties used by the Administrative Center of Jehovah's Witnesses, located in Solnechnoye, near St. Petersburg.
The April20 ,2017, Supreme Court decision ordered all of the Witnesses' legal entities liquidated and their properties confiscated, including the properties used by the Administrative Center.
However, the property in question is owned by a U.S. entity - Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania (WTPA).
The prosecutor is therefore attempting to invalidate a 17 - year - old contract that legally transferred the property to WTPA.
The contract was never in question prior to the Supreme Court decision, and WTPA has been paying taxes on the property since the transfer.
The authorities are now stooping to subterfuge in order to legitimize their ultimate goal of seizing the property.
At the preliminary hearing on November29 ,2017, the judge dismissed all motions filed by the Witnesses' attorneys, paving the way for the prosecutor's case.
Beyond the potential loss of the property, worth millions of dollars, the Center was home to nearly 400Russian citizens and foreign nationals, some of whom have lived there for 20 or more years.
The move from their home and the disruption in their volunteer religious service in behalf of their fellow Russians have been traumatic.
The hearing on the merits of the case will begin on December7 ,2017, at 2:00 p.m. in the Sestroretskiy District Court in St. Petersburg.
Taking a snooze in Saigon airport's new sleeping zone
Passengers no longer have to sit on the floor waiting for their flights.
The waiting area at the international terminal of Tan Son Nhat airport has been recently expanded with a 100 - square - meter sleeping zone equipped with long wooden chairs and 20 sleeping loungers that anyone can use for free.
A group of Canadian tourists leaving Vietnam after a one - week visit relax on the loungers.
They said they've been to Tan Son Nhat before, but were forced to sit on the ground while waiting for their flight.
"Very nice, very clean, very professional," a foreign tourist said, sitting on one of the chairs.
Those who need more privacy can pay $7 an hour to use one of ten mini sleeping rooms.
The rooms have alarm systems so that users do not miss their flights.
Each sleeping room is four square meters and can accommodate an adult and a child under seven years old.
Drinking water and cold towels are part of the package.
The airport has also opened a kids' zone of 40 square meters with slides.
The new facilities were opened on October 26 after the Airports Corporation of Vietnam spent VND1 .5 trillion ($67.2 million) on the first phase of the terminal's expansion.
The second phase of the expansion is expected to cost VND787 billion and finish next year, raising the terminal's capacity from the current 10 million to 13 million passengers a year.
There is also a new range of convenience stores selling food, drinks and souvenirs from less than $1 apiece.
Vingroup rejects rumours of selling stakes Vinmec and Vinschool
Vietnam's leading private conglomerate Vingroup has denied reports that it is considering selling Vinmec and Vinschool to focus on core businesses.
"We affirm that we do n't have any schemes to sell the shares of Vinmec and Vinschool.
The two units are meaningful in Vingroup's ecosystem and we pledge to develop the system to become better and more comprehensive, "according to a Vingroup representative on September 11.
The conglomerate is still seeking cooperation opportunities with prestigious partners in Vietnam and abroad to take Vinmec to the international level.
For Vinschool, the group has no plans for overseas expansion.
Previously, an "exclusive" news report by Reuters stated that Vingroup was considering selling a controlling stake in its education and hospital units.
Vinschool now has 27 education establishments and Vinmec runs seven hospitals in Vietnam.
Two partners have expressed their interest in the two businesses after unofficial negotiations, Reuters reported.
Reports quickly drew attention as Vingroup sold its retail unit Vincommerce to the local Masan Group.
In 2016, Vingroup declared that it would develop Vinmec and Vinschool into a non-profit model, giving all its profits to society.
Four new cases take Vietnam's Covid - 19 count to 249
Vietnam reported four new coronavirus infections Tuesday evening, three of them overseas returnees and one linked to HCMC hotspot Buddha Bar & Grill.
"Patient 247," a 28 - year - old man residing in Ward 1, Binh Thanh District, HCMC, works with two people connected to the HCMC's Buddha Bar & Grill, the nation's second - biggest Covid - 19 hotspot.
He manages the office of Gia Dinh Shoes Co. Ltd. at 20A Dong Khoi Street, Thanh Phu Commune, Vinh Cuu District, Dong Nai Province.
The company has another office in An Phu Dong Ward, District 2, HCMC.
As a colleague of two infected Brazilians who also work for the same company, the office manager had come into close contact with them.
One of his colleagues, "Patient 124," is a Brazilian man, 52, who lives in HCMC's District 2.
On March 14, he joined a party at the Buddha Bar & Grill in Thao Dien Ward of HCMC's District 2 and was quarantined on March 22 before testing Covid - 19 positive.
The other colleague, "Patient 151," is a 45 - year - old Brazilian woman residing in Thao Dien.
After "Patient 124" was confirmed, "Patient 247" was sent to a quarantine camp in Dong Nai on March 24.
Two days later, he tested negative for the novel coronavirus.
However, at the quarantine camp, he had stayed in the same room as four others who'd also been in close contact with Patients 124 and 151.
On April 6, his samples were tested again, and this time, the results came back Covid - 19 positive.
He has been transferred to the Dong Nai Lung Hospital for treatment.
The four people who'd been quarantined in the same room as "Patient 247" will continue to stay in quarantine for another 14 days.
For now, they have yet to show any Covid - 19 symptoms.
"Patient 247" brought the number of cases related to the Buddha Bar & Grill to 19.
The nation's biggest hotspot to date, the Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi, has 44 cases.
The other three cases confirmed Tuesday evening are Vietnamese returning from abroad who were quarantined on arrival.
"Patient 246" is a 33 - year - old man from Yen Thanh District in the central province of Nghe An.
He works as a chef in Moscow, Russia, and returned to Vietnam on Aeroflot flight SU290, seat 49F, on March 25.
He tested positive on April 6 and is undergoing treatment at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi's Dong Anh District.
"Patient 248," 20, flew from the U.S. to Vietnam, transiting in Japan on Japan Airlines flight JL079.
After landing in HCMC March 23, he was sent to a quarantine camp at a university dormitory in Thu Duc District and stayed in the same room with two other people.
On April 5, his samples tested positive.
His two roommates have been placed under quarantine for a further 14 days while he has been sent to the Cu Chi District field hospital.
"Patient 249" is a 55 - year - old man who flew back from the U.S., transited in Hong Kong, and arrived in Vietnam on March 22.
After complaining of a headache and fever, his samples were tested and found positive.
He is being treated at Hanoi's National Hospital of Tropical Diseases.
The Covid - 19 pandemic has so far claimed almost 76,000 lives as it hit 209 countries and territories.
Worldwide, it's estimated that one out of every three women has been a victim of violence.
Also, women are paid less than men, and they are less likely to hold positions of leadership.
Female babies are even aborted at a higher rate than male babies.
This phenomenon is so common in some countries that it even has a name: femicide.
Yet, in one remote Indian village, women rule the roost.
Known as having the cleanest village around, the Khasi people follow a matriarchal system rather than a patriarchal system.
Daughters inherit their mothers' land.
Men rarely, if ever, own land.
Women hold all of the economic power.
Grandmothers are the heads of household and children take their mothers' family names.
Daughters are so prized in the Khasi tradition, that a family of only sons is considered unlucky.
One study even showed that Khasi women are much more likely to be competitive.
In most other places, men are more likely to play competitive sports and compete for jobs and raises, but with the Khasi people, it's the opposite.
When given the option, 54% of Khasi women chose to compete, while only 39% of the Khasi men competed.
Khasi women appear to be more confident than men in their communities.
Neighboring villages are afraid of their men falling in love with Khasi women, because they do n't want them to give up their independence and economic authority.
Khasi women say they ca n't trust men to handle finances.
According to some Khasi men, it's not fair.
They say that even their language favors women.
When a noun is something useful (like a tree used for firewood), it becomes feminine.
Some Khasi men say that their tradition makes men feel worthless.
Many Khasi men have joined men's liberation groups.
These men have a lot in common with certain women of the late 1800s, who were known as suffragettes and who fought for a woman's right to vote.
With all the inequality towards women in the world, it's hard to shed a tear for the Kasi men, but what do you think?
Should they rise up and demand equal rights?
On September4, 2020, the Kursk Regional Court will decide whether or not Brother Dennis Christensen can be released from prison.
He has been in prison since May 25, 2017.
On June 23, 2020, the Lgov District Court mitigated the remainder of Brother Christensen's six - year prison sentence to a fine of 400,000 rubles ($5,300 U.S.).
However, two days after the ruling, the prosecutor filed an appeal that halted BrotherChristensen's early release.
On March 7, 2019, the Appeals Court in Khanty - Mansiysk, Russia, overturned the decision of the Surgut City Trial Court to detain Brother Artur Severinchik.
BrotherSeverinchik is one of three brothers who was placed in pretrial detention on February17, following raids in the cities of Surgut and Lyantor.
The court has denied the release of the two other brothers, Yevgeniy Fedin and Sergey Loginov.
The situation has garnered international attention.
The European Court of Human Rights ordered an independent medical examination of BrotherLoginov, who was subjected to physical abuse while he was detained.
We are grateful that BrotherSeverinchik was released.
We continue to pray that our imprisoned brothers in Russia trust in Jehovah, remembering that with his support they "will never be shaken."
Hackers are creating phishing pages and websites with interfaces similar to Facebook's, to steal users' names and passwords.
"An experienced hacker can collect 10,000 users' accounts a day.
Each account is priced at VND3,000 - 5,000.
This means they can earn VND1 billion a month by selling the ‘ corpses' of these accounts, "said Tri Duc, an IT expert who works in the US and monitors many Vietnamese groups of hackers.
Experts see the tricks as only ‘ rudimentary traps', but tens of thousands of users fall into that trap every day.
"Not everyone is vigilant enough, especially those who often use dubious applications.
The websites with pornographic content may have latent risks, "Duc said.
Vietnamese hackers also hijack international accounts for different purposes.
Facebook recently allowed Vietnamese users to connect personal accounts to create fanpages.
This feature has been exploited by hackers for a long time.
Hackers also prefer Indonesian accounts because of the ease and the high number of people in the country.
Selling ‘ bogus' accounts
After hijacking a user's account, hackers change the names and replace the avatar with images of Vietnamese "hot" girls, then make friends with thousands of people.
The "raw" accounts, after changes in names and cover images, are called by Vietnamese hackers "change" accounts.
They then se these accounts to create pages, and friends will become page followers.
They then combine the numbers of ‘ likes' from the pages.
"The fanpages with millions of likes are sometimes offered for sale on MMO websites.
Despite efforts made, Facebook still can not settle the problem, "said Le Minh Hiep, who called himself a Facebook service provider.
Also according to Hiep, hacked accounts can be used to gain Facebook's confidence.
In general, Facebook will trust accounts that have been operating for years and updating regularly.
Once gaining confidence, the accounts will have a higher success rate in creating ads and sending spam messages than newly created accounts.
In addition, hacked accounts will be used as ‘ zombies' for trading likes, comments and video views.
"Some veteran hackers now own 3 - 4 million accounts of this type.
They are sold to serve the tricks that dodge Facebook's rules, "Hiep said.
In related news, a large number of Vietnamese online businesses utilising the social network as a trading platform has been affected as Facebook has just blocked API.
Blocking API is believed to be a move to reaffirm the apology after the scandal of Cambridge Analytica company breaking into 50 million users' personal information.
(New York) – Vietnamese authorities should immediately release the Hoa Hao Buddhist activist Nguyen Van Lia and drop all charges against him, Human Rights Watch said today.
His trial is scheduled for the morning of December 13, 2011, in the People's Court of Cho Moi district, An Giang province.
Nguyen Van Lia, 71, is a longtime adherent of Hoa Hao Buddhism, a religious group often suppressed by the government, and the co-author of several Hoa Hao Buddhist religious instruction texts and books.
He is charged with violating article 258 of the penal code for "abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the state," an opaque crime that could result in a sentence of up to seven years.
"All signs point to religious persecution in this case," said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch.
"Nguyen Van Lia is mainly known for his advocacy of the Hoa Hao faith, and raising the oppression of this group with foreign diplomats.
These are activities fully protected under Vietnam's international human rights and constitutional obligations. "
He was arrested on April 24 with his wife, Tran Thi Bac Lon, on what appeared to be a trumped - up traffic violation as they drove to attend a remembrance ceremony for another deceased Hoa Hao follower.
Authorities released his wife that night, but have detained him ever since and prevented his family from seeing him for five months after his arrest.
On a visit on November 30, Nguyen Van Lia's family first learned he was being charged with violating article 258.
The family has publicly raised serious concerns about the deterioration of his health.
He has high blood pressure, has lost most of his hearing, and has several broken ribs from past injuries.
Nguyen Van Lia maintains his innocence.
He told his family that the police tried to coerce an admission of guilt from him during interrogations and said that when he refused to sign a document prepared by the police, the officers used force to press his fingerprint onto the document.
"It is inhumane to imprison a sick and elderly person whose only crime is to peacefully advocate for his religious faith," Robertson said.
"The authorities should unconditionally release Nguyen Van Lia and allow him to seek proper medical treatment."
In 2003, Nguyen Van Lia was sentenced to three years in prison for commemorating the anniversary of the death of the Hoa Hao Buddhist founder, Huynh Phu So, who had never returned from a meeting with communist representatives in 1947.
Nguyen Van Lia was part of a small group of Hoa Hao Buddhist practitioners who met with representatives from the US Commission on International Religious Freedom in Ho Chi Minh City in May 2009.
He spoke about the Vietnamese government's repression of unsanctioned Hoa Hao Buddhist groups.
After the meeting, he was put under intrusive surveillance and repeatedly harassed by the local police of Cho Moi district, An Giang province.
In December 2010, Nguyen Van Lia and three other Hoa Hao Buddhist activists met with representatives of the State Department at the US Consulate in Ho Chi Minh City.
He was arrested four months later.
"The United States should demand that Vietnam immediately release Nguyen Van Lia and cease punishing peaceful religious advocates," said Phil Robertson.
Unsanctioned Hoa Hao Buddhist groups have long been a target of government repression.
In August 2005, after one serious crackdown, a Hoa Hao Buddhist follower, Tran Van Ut, burned himself to death in protest.
At least 13 other Hoa Hao Buddhist activists are serving long prison terms.
The most recent arrest, occurred in July 2, 2011, when Dong Thap province police arrested Hoa Hao Buddhist activist Tran Hoai An as he returned from visiting Hoa Hao Buddhist prisoners.
Tran Hoai An was also among the four Hoa Hao Buddhist activists who met with American diplomats in December 2010.
Founded in 1939 by Huynh Phu So, Hoa Hao is a Buddhist sect based in the western Mekong delta.
Some Hoa Hao adherents opposed the Republic of Vietnam in the mid 1950s as well as the communist insurgency throughout the Vietnam War.
After 1975, the Hoa Hao sect was not recognized as an official religion by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.
A section of the Hoa Hao church agreed to submit to state supervision and gained official recognition in 1999.
But other Hoa Hao Buddhist factions remain at odds with the government.
"Vietnam's repression of unsanctioned religious groups, including Hoa Hao Buddhists, is both systematic and severe," Robertson said.
"The US and other nations should publicly raise concerns about Vietnam's sorry track record on freedom of religion as a top priority in all their dealings with Hanoi."
Vietnam's Covid - 19 test kits meet European standards
Vietnam - made Covid - 19 test kits have been certified as meeting European standards by the United Kingdom's Department of Health and Social Care, reported the Government news website.
Phan Quoc Viet, general director of Viet A Technologies JSC, said that the UK department has issued a CE certificate and a certificate of free sale for the test kits, which are being manufactured by the firm in collaboration with the Vietnam Military Medical Academy.
Even though the UK left the European Union on January 31, the European Pharmaceutical Law is still being applied by Britain until December 31.
Under EU regulations, if any EU member grants a CE to any product, that product can be sold in Europe.
As such, the Covid - 19 test kits manufactured in Vietnam can be sold in all EU member countries, including Britain.
Following the kits' certification by the UK, some partners have registered to buy and exclusively distribute them to Britain, India, Mexico, the United States and some countries in Europe.
Earlier in March, as many as 20 countries made deals to purchase Vietnam's Covid - 19 test kits.
In the initial stage, Viet A Company will export the product to Iran, Finland, Malaysia and Ukraine.
Iran has registered to buy 4,000 test kits, while Ukraine has placed an order of 300 test kits.
Viet A Company can turn out 10,000 test kits per day.
It can triple production to meet the demand from the local market and for export or international support.
Vietnamese hackers spread malicious code, steal information
Facebook has accused Vietnamese hackers of spreading malicious code and stealing user information from its platform.
The U.S. company said on Thursday that it is taking measures against independent hacker groups from Vietnam and Bangladesh because there are some groups from the two countries that use its website to spread malicious code, steal user information and hijack accounts.
Vietnamese hackers used three forms of attacks - via social engineering, via Android applications, and by spreading malicious codes, according to the social media giant.
Facebook said Vietnamese hackers have built fake characters and organizations on social networks, creating a legitimate cover to reach the target they want to attack.
They also build pages to attract followers and then trick users into installing malware, it said.
They create apps on Play Store, get users to install them, and monitor their devices.
The hackers also attack Facebook users by spreading malicious codes through websites created by them or existing ones that are compromised to install them, it said.
Another form of attack is through shortened links, it said.
Facebook has been following this group of hackers for years and said the group is linked with CyberOne, an information technology company based in Ho Chi Minh City.
But CyberOne Group recently told Reuters it is not related to the hacker group.
Facebook also accused Bangladesh hacker groups DoN and CRAF of hacking and taking over administrator powers in major accounts, deleting the remaining administrators, and then disabling the accounts.
It is taking a number of measures to prevent and mitigate damage caused by the hackers, including notifying users if their accounts had been potentially attacked.
It advises users not to click on suspicious links and not to download software from untrusted sources.
"Robam kbach boran," or the art of Khmer classical dance, is more than 1,000 years old.
It was developed as a prayer in movement for rain and fertility, and a prosperity that this meant for an agricultural society.
Dancers who were both men and women were offered to temples where they served as living bridges between heaven and earth.
Their dancing bodies carried the prayers of the people up to the gods, and the will of the deities was delivered back through them to the people and the land.
There are a lot of curves in Khmer dance.
Our backs are arched, our knees are bent, our toes are curled, our elbows are hyperflexed and our fingers are curved backwards.
All of these curves create a serpentine impression, and this is important because before the introduction of major religions, Khmers, and people all over the world practiced animism.
Serpents were especially important in this belief system because in their fluid, curvilinear movement, they mimicked the flow of water.
So to invoke the serpent in your dancing body then was to conjure the image of rivers cutting across the earth: inspire the flow of life - giving waters.
As you can see then, Khmer classical dance is a transformation of nature, of both the physical world around us and of our own internal universe.
We have four primary hand gestures that we use.
Can we do them together?
This is a tree.
That tree will grow, and then it will have leaves.
After it has leaves, it'll have flowers, and after it has flowers, it'll have fruit.
That fruit will drop and a new tree will grow.
And in those four gestures is the cycle of life.
These four gestures are then used to create a whole entire language with which dancers express themselves.
So for example, I can say, "I."
"I."
In dance that would be...
Or I can say...
"Hey you, come here, come here."
"Come here," or, "Go, go."
(Laughter) "Go."
And everything from...
to sadness, to -- (Stomping) anger can be expressed through the dance as well.
There's a certain magic in the way that things are filtered, transformed and put together to create limitless possibilities in art.
The Khmer word for art, silapak, in fact, at its root, means "magic."
The artist -- the silapakar, or the silapakarani, then, is nothing short of a magician.
I am very proud to say that I belong to a long line of magicians, from my teacher, Sophiline Cheam Shapiro, to her teachers who were stars in the royal palace, to the ancient dancers of Angkor and to the primal villagers from which the art form originally took life.
That said, our cherished heritage was once almost completely destroyed.
If you are wearing glasses, please stand up.
If you speak more than one language, please stand up.
If you have light skin, please stand up.
Your glasses meant that you could afford health care.
Your light skin meant you did n't have to work beneath the sun.
Under the Khmer Rouge, who took over Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, we would all be dead now, targeted because of our assumed privilege.
You see, the Khmer Rouge looked to Cambodia, and they saw centuries of rigid inequality.
The king and the few elites around him had all the pleasures and comforts of the world while the mass majority suffered from backbreaking labor and harsh poverty.
You do n't need a history book to see that this is true.
The Khmer word for "I," for "me," is khnhom.
This very same word can also mean "slave" and dancers were in fact known as knhom preah robam, or "slaves of the sacred dance."
The Khmer Rouge sought to end slavery in Cambodia, yet somehow they turned everyone into slaves to do it.
They became the oppression that they sought to end.
They evacuated the capital and forced people into labor camps.
They tore families apart and brainwashed children against their own parents.
Everywhere, people were dying and being killed, losing their lives from disease, overwork, execution and starvation.
The result of this is that an entire third of Cambodia's population was lost in less than four years, and in that number were 90 percent of Khmer dance artists.
In other words, nine out of 10 visions for the tradition and future were lost.
Thankfully, however, it was my teacher's teachers, Chea Samy, Soth Sam On and Chheng Phon, who would lead the revival of the art form from the ashes of war and genocide: one student, one gesture, one dance at a time.
They wrote the love, magic, beauty, history and philosophy of our lineage into the bodies of the next generation.
Nearly 40 years later, Khmer classical dance has been revived to new heights.
Yet somehow it still exists in a vulnerable environment.
The disastrous effects of war still haunt Khmer people today.
It is written in our bodies, manifested in a genetic passage of PTSD and in families facing cyclical poverty and immense cultural rifts and language barriers.
Yet beauty is a most resilient thing.
Beauty has this ability to grow anywhere and everywhere at any time.
Beauty is what connects people through time and place.
Beauty is a liberation from suffering.
As Khmer artists work to revive our culture and country, we find that there are many paths in which to move forward into the future.
And in a tradition where we often do n't know the dancer's names, who they were, what their lives were like, what they felt, let me propose that we move forward honestly and openly from "khnhom."
Khnhom not as in slave, but as in conscious service.
Khnhom: "I," "me," "flowering."
My name is Prumsodun Ok.
I am Khmer, and I am American.
I am the child of refugees, a creator, a healer, and a builder of bridges.
I am my teacher's first male student in a tradition understood by many as female, and I founded Cambodia's first gay dance company.
I am the incarnation of the beauty, dreams and power of those who came before me.
The convergence of past, present and future, and of individual and collective.
Let me then play that ancient and ageless role of the artist as messenger, by sharing the words of Chheng Phon "A garden with only one type of flower, or flowers of only one color, is no good."
This is a reminder that our strength, growth, survival and very existence, lies in diversity.
It is, however, a message of courage as well.
For a flower does not ask for anyone's permission to bloom.
It was born to offer itself to the world.
Fearless love is its nature.
What is love?
Seriously, though, what is it?
What is love?
A verb?
A noun?
A universal truth?
An ideal?
A common thread of all religions?
A cult?
There's no shortage of answers.
Some are all - encompassing.
It conquers all.
It's all you need.
It's all there is.
These are all comparisons, though, ways of defining it by contrast, by saying it's more important than all other things, but is it?
Sure, love matters more than your standard turkey sandwich, but does it matter more than shelter?
No matter your answer, you're just ranking it, not defining it.
Another challenge to defining love is we often try to do so while falling into it or out of it.
Would you trust someone who just won the lottery to accurately define the concept of currency?
Or, I do n't know, ask a guy to define bears while he's fending them off?
Or is romance not like winning the lottery?
Are break ups not like bear attacks?
Bad comparisons?
That's my point.
I'm not thinking right because I'm in love, so ha!
Taking a step back, or taking a cold shower, whatever, love is potentially the most intensely thought about thing in all of human history.
And despite centuries upon centuries of obsession, it still overwhelms us.
Some say it's a feeling, a magical emotion, a feeling for someone like you've never felt before.
But feelings are fluid, not very concrete foundation for a definition.
Sometimes you hate the person you love.
Plus, come on, you've felt feelings like it before, sort of in miniature.
Your relationships with your family shape your relationships with partners.
And your love for your partner may be in its own dynamic relationship, healthy or totally weird, with the love of your parents and siblings.
Love is also a set of behaviors we associate with the feeling: Holding hands, kissing, hugging, public displays of affection, dating, marriage, having kids, or just sex.
But these loving actions can be subjective or culturally relative.
You may love or be someone who ca n't have kids or does n't want to, who believes in marriage but also in divorce, who's from a culture where people do n't really date the way we think of dating, or who just does n't want to make out on the bus.
But if love is a thing that we can define, then how can it mean opposite things for so many people?
So, maybe love's just all in your head, a personal mystery winding through your neural pathways and lighting up pleasing, natural rewards in your nervous system.
Perhaps these rewards are addictive.
Perhaps love is a temporary or permanent addiction to a person, just like a person can be addicted to a drug.
I do n't mean to be edgy like some pop song.
Evidence shows that chemicals in your brain stimulated by another person can make you develop a habit for that person.
The person comes to satisfy a physiological craving, and you want more.
But then sometimes, slowly or suddenly, you do n't.
You've fallen out of love, become unaddicted, for a spell.
Does one develop a tolerance or hit a limit?
Why do some lovers stay addicted to each other their entire lives?
Perhaps to create new lives, to proliferate their species?
Maybe love is just human DNA's optimal method for bringing about its own replication.
There are evolutionary arguments regarding every human mating behavior, from how we display ourselves to potential mates, to how we treat each other in relationships, to how we raise kids.
Thus, some argue that the feeling you think you feel in your soul is just biology's way to make you continue our species.
Nature has selected you to have crushes on hotties, just like it makes monkeys have crushes on hot monkeys, and biology marches on.
But is that all love is?
Or, perhaps worse, is it just a construct, some fake concept we all convince each other to try to live up to for a fake sense of purpose?
Maybe it is a construct, but let's be more precise about what a construct is because love is constructed from reality: Our experiences, feelings, brain chemistry, cultural expectations, our lives.
And this edifice can be viewed through countless dimensions: scientific, emotional, historical, spiritual, legal, or just personal.
If no two people are the same, no two people's love is the same either.
So, in every loving relationship, there's a lot to talk about and partners should be open to that, or the relationship probably wo n't last.
Love is always up for discussion and, sure, under construction.
So, if we ca n't define it, that's a good sign.
It means we're all still making it.
Wait, I did n't mean, you know what I meant.
Pat Mitchell: You have brought us images from the Yemen Times.
And take us through those, and introduce us to another Yemen.
Nadia Al - Sakkaf: Well, I'm glad to be here.
And I would like to share with you all some of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen.
This picture shows a revolution started by women, and it shows women and men leading a mixed protest.
The other picture is the popularity of the real need for change.
So many people are there.
The intensity of the upspring.
This picture shows that the revolution has allowed opportunities for training, for education.
These women are learning about first aid and their rights according to the constitution.
I love this picture.
I just wanted to show that over 60 percent of the Yemeni population are 15 years and below.
And they were excluded from decision - making, and now they are in the forefront of the news, raising the flag.
English -- you will see, this is jeans and tights, and an English expression -- the ability to share with the world what is going on in our own country.
And expression also, it has brought talents.
Yemenis are using cartoons and art, paintings, comics, to tell the world and each other about what's going on.
Obviously, there's always the dark side of it.
And this is just one of the less - gruesome pictures of the revolution and the cost that we have to pay.
The solidarity of millions of Yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing.
And finally, lots of people are saying that Yemen's revolution is going to break the country.
Is it going to be so many different countries?
Is it going to be another Somalia?
But we want to tell the world that, no, under the one flag, we'll still remain as Yemeni people.
PM: Thank you for those images, Nadia.
And they do, in many ways, tell a different story than the story of Yemen, the one that is often in the news.
And yet, you yourself defy all those characterizations.
So let's talk about the personal story for a moment.
Your father is murdered.
The Yemen Times already has a strong reputation in Yemen as an independent English language newspaper.
How did you then make the decision and assume the responsibilities of running a newspaper, especially in such times of conflict?
NA: Well, let me first warn you that I'm not the traditional Yemeni girl.
I've guessed you've already noticed this by now.
(Laughter) In Yemen, most women are veiled and they are sitting behind doors and not very much part of the public life.
But there's so much potential.
I wish I could show you my Yemen.
I wish you could see Yemen through my eyes.
Then you would know that there's so much to it.
And I was privileged because I was born into a family, my father would always encourage the boys and the girls.
He would say we are equal.
And he was such an extraordinary man.
And even my mother -- I owe it to my family.
A story: I studied in India.
And in my third year, I started becoming confused because I was Yemeni, but I was also mixing up with a lot of my friends in college.
And I went back home and I said, "Daddy, I do n't know who I am.
I'm not a Yemeni; I'm not an Indian. "
And he said, "You are the bridge."
And that is something I will keep in my heart forever.
So since then I've been the bridge, and a lot of people have walked over me.
PM: I do n't think so.
(Laughter) NA: But it just helps tell that some people are change agents in the society.
And when I became editor - in - chief after my brother actually -- my father passed away in 1999, and then my brother until 2005 -- and everybody was betting that I will not be able to do it.
"What's this young girl coming in and showing off because it's her family business," or something.
I did n't want to clash with people.
But with all due respect to all the men, and the older men especially, they did not want me around.
It was very hard, you know, to impose my authority.
But a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do.
(Applause) And in the first year, I had to fire half of the men.
(Laughter) (Applause) Brought in more women.
Brought in younger men.
And we have a more gender - balanced newsroom today.
The other thing is that it's about professionalism.
It's about proving who you are and what you can do.
And I do n't know if I'm going to be boasting now, but in 2006 alone, we won three international awards.
One of them is the IPI Free Media Pioneer Award.
So that was the answer to all the Yemeni people.
And I want to score a point here, because my husband is in the room over there.
If you could please stand up, [unclear].
He has been very supportive of me.
(Applause) PM: And we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper.
But in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have, you have become a bridge between an older and traditional society and the one that you are now creating at the paper.
And so along with changing who worked there, you must have come up against another positioning that we always run into, in particular with women, and it has to do with outside image, dress, the veiled woman.
So how have you dealt with this on a personal level as well as the women who worked for you?
NA: As you know, the image of a lot of Yemeni women is a lot of black and covered, veiled women.
And a lot of it is because women are not able, are not free, to show their face to their self.
It's a lot of traditional imposing coming by authority figures such as the men, the grandparents and so on.
And it's economic empowerment and the ability for a woman to say, "I am as much contributing to this family, or more, than you are."
And the more empowered the women become, the more they are able to remove the veil, for example, or to drive their own car or to have a job or to be able to travel.
So the other face of Yemen is actually one that lies behind the veil, and it's economic empowerment mostly that allows the woman to just uncover it.
And I have done this throughout my work.
I've tried to encourage young girls.
We started with, you can take it off in the office.
And then after that, you can take it off on assignments.
And I need to prove to them that, yes, you can still be married, you can still be a mother, and you can still be respected within the society, but at the same time, that does n't mean you [should] just be one of the crowd.
You can be yourself and have your face.
PM: But by putting yourself personally out there -- both projecting a different image of Yemeni women, but also what you have made possible for the women who work at the paper -- has this put you in personal danger?
NA: Well the Yemen Times, across 20 years, has been through so much.
We've suffered prosecution; the paper was closed down more than three times.
It's an independent newspaper, but tell that to the people in charge.
They think that if there's anything against them, then we are being an opposition newspaper.
And very, very difficult times.
Some of my reporters were arrested.
We had some court cases.
My father was assassinated.
Today, we are in a much better situation.
We've created the credibility.
And in times of revolution or change like today, it is very important for independent media to have a voice.
It's very important for you to go to YemenTimes.com, and it's very important to listen to our voice.
And this is probably something I'm going to share with you in Western media probably -- and how there's a lot of stereotypes -- thinking of Yemen in one single frame: this is what Yemen is all about.
And that's not fair.
A lot of reporters come to Yemen and they want to write a story on Al - Qaeda or terrorism.
And I just wanted to share with you: there's one reporter that came.
And he wanted to do a documentary on what his editors wanted.
And he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me -- hip hop -- that there are young Yemeni men who express themselves through dancing and puchu puchu.
(Laughter) That thing.
I'm not so old.
I'm just not in touch.
(Laughter) (Applause) PM: Yes, you are.
And it definitely does give a different image of Yemen.
You spoke about the responsibility of the press.
And certainly, when we look at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others and we've created fear and danger, often from lack of knowledge, lack of real understanding, how do you see the way that the Western press in particular is covering this and all other stories out of the region, but in particular, in your country?
NA: Well there is a saying that says, "You fear what you do n't know, and you hate what you fear."
So it's about the lack of research, basically.
It's almost, "Do your homework," -- some involvement.
And you can not do parachute reporting -- just jump into a country for two days and think that you've done your homework and a story.
So I wish that the world would know my Yemen, my country, my people.
I am an example, and there are others like me.
We may not be that many, but if we are promoted as a good, positive example, there will be others -- men and women -- who can eventually bridge the gap -- again, coming to the bridge -- between Yemen and the world and telling first about recognition and then about communication and compassion.
I think Yemen is going to be in a very bad situation in the next two or three years.
It's natural.
But after the two years, which is a price we are willing to pay, we are going to stand up again on our feet, but in the new Yemen with a younger and more empowered people -- democratic.
(Applause) PM: Nadia, I think you've just given us a very different view of Yemen.
And certainly you yourself and what you do have given us a view of the future that we will embrace and be grateful for.
And the very best of luck to you.
NA: On Twitter also.
PM: So you are plugged in.
When I was in fourth grade, my teacher said to us one day: "There are as many even numbers as there are numbers."
"Really?", I thought.
Well, yeah, there are infinitely many of both, so I suppose there are the same number of them.
But even numbers are only part of the whole numbers, all the odd numbers are left over, so there's got to be more whole numbers than even numbers, right?
To see what my teacher was getting at, let's first think about what it means for two sets to be the same size.
What do I mean when I say I have the same number of fingers on my right hand as I do on left hand?
Of course, I have five fingers on each, but it's actually simpler than that.
I do n't have to count, I only need to see that I can match them up, one to one.
In fact, we think that some ancient people who spoke languages that did n't have words for numbers greater than three used this sort of magic.
For instance, if you let your sheep out of a pen to graze, you can keep track of how many went out by setting aside a stone for each one, and putting those stones back one by one when the sheep return, so you know if any are missing without really counting.
As another example of matching being more fundamental than counting, if I'm speaking to a packed auditorium, where every seat is taken and no one is standing, I know that there are the same number of chairs as people in the audience, even though I do n't know how many there are of either.
So, what we really mean when we say that two sets are the same size is that the elements in those sets can be matched up one by one in some way.
My fourth grade teacher showed us the whole numbers laid out in a row, and below each we have it s double.
As you can see, the bottom row contains all the even numbers, and we have a one - to - one match.
That is, there are as many even numbers as there are numbers.
But what still bothers us is our distress over the fact that even numbers seem to be only part of the whole numbers.
But does this convince you that I do n't have the same number of fingers on my right hand as I do on my left?
Of course not.
It does n't matter if you try to match the elements in some way and it does n't work, that does n't convince us of anything.
If you can find one way in which the elements of two sets do match up, then we say those two sets have the same number of elements.
Can you make a list of all the fractions?
This might be hard, there are a lot of fractions!
And it's not obvious what to put first, or how to be sure all of them are on the list.
Nevertheless, there is a very clever way that we can make a list of all the fractions.
This was first done by Georg Cantor, in the late eighteen hundreds.
First, we put all the fractions into a grid.
They're all there.
For instance, you can find, say, 117/243, in the 117th row and 243rd column.
Now we make a list out of this by starting at the upper left and sweeping back and forth diagonally, skipping over any fraction, like 2 / 2, that represents the same number as one the we've already picked.
We get a list of all the fractions, which means we've created a one - to - one match between the whole numbers and the fractions, despite the fact that we thought maybe there ought to be more fractions.
OK, here's where it gets really interesting.
You may know that not all real numbers -- that is, not all the numbers on a number line -- are fractions.
The square root of two and pi, for instance.
Any number like this is called irrational.
Not because it's crazy, or anything, but because the fractions are ratios of whole numbers, and so are called rationals; meaning the rest are non-rational, that is, irrational.
Irrationals are represented by infinite, non -repeating decimals.
So, can we make a one - to - one match between the whole numbers and the set of all the decimals, both the rationals and the irrationals?
That is, can we make a list of all the decimal numbers?
Cantor showed that you ca n't.
Not merely that we do n't know how, but that it ca n't be done.
Look, suppose you claim you have made a list of all the decimals.
I'm going to show you that you did n't succeed, by producing a decimal that is not on your list.
I'll construct my decimal one place at a time.
For the first decimal place of my number, I'll look at the first decimal place of your first number.
If it's a one, I'll make mine a two; otherwise I'll make mine a one.
For the second place of my number, I'll look at the second place of your second number.
Again, if yours is a one, I'll make mine a two, and otherwise I'll make mine a one.
See how this is going?
The decimal I've produced ca n't be on your list.
Could it be, say, your 143rd number?
No, because the 143rd place of my decimal is different from the 143rd place of your 143rd number.
I made it that way.
Your list is incomplete.
It does n't contain my decimal number.
And, no matter what list you give me, I can do the same thing, and produce a decimal that's not on that list.
So we're faced with this astounding conclusion: The decimal numbers can not be put on a list.
They represent a bigger infinity that the infinity of whole numbers.
So, even though we're familiar with only a few irrationals, like square root of two and pi, the infinity of irrationals is actually greater than the infinity of fractions.
Someone once said that the rationals -- the fractions -- are like the stars in the night sky.
The irrationals are like the blackness.
Cantor also showed that, for any infinite set, forming a new set made of all the subsets of the original set represents a bigger infinity than that original set.
This means that, once you have one infinity, you can always make a bigger one by making the set of all subsets of that first set.
And then an even bigger one by making the set of all the subsets of that one.
And so, there are an infinite number of infinities of different sizes.
If these ideas make you uncomfortable, you are not alone.
Some of the greatest mathematicians of Cantor's day were very upset with this stuff.
They tried to make these different infinities irrelevant, to make mathematics work without them somehow.
Cantor was even vilified personally, and it got so bad for him that he suffered severe depression, and spent the last half of his life in and out of mental institutions.
But eventually, his ideas won out.
Today, they're considered fundamental and magnificent.
All research mathematicians accept these ideas, every college math major learns them, and I've explained them to you in a few minutes.
Some day, perhaps, they'll be common knowledge.
There's more.
We just pointed out that the set of decimal numbers -- that is, the real numbers -- is a bigger infinity than the set of whole numbers.
Cantor wondered whether there are infinities of different sizes between these two infinities.
He did n't believe there were, but could n't prove it.
In 1900, the great mathematician David Hilbert listed the continuum hypothesis as the most important unsolved problem in mathematics.
The 20th century saw a resolution of this problem, but in a completely unexpected, paradigm - shattering way.
In the 1920s, Kurt Gödel showed that you can never prove that the continuum hypothesis is false.
Then, in the 1960s, Paul J. Cohen showed that you can never prove that the continuum hypothesis is true.
Taken together, these results mean that there are unanswerable questions in mathematics.
A very stunning conclusion.
Mathematics is rightly considered the pinnacle of human reasoning, but we now know that even mathematics has its limitations.
Still, mathematics has some truly amazing things for us to think about.
People often think the word "doubt" spelling is a little crazy because of the letter "b".
Since it does n't spell a sound, most folks ca n't figure out what it's doing there.
But in spite of what most of us learn in school, sound is never the most important aspect of spelling an English word.
A word's meaning and history need to come first.
To doubt means to question, to waver, to hesitate.
As a noun, it means uncertainty or confusion.
The present - day English word "doubt" started as a Latin word, "dubitare".
It first moved from Latin into French where it lost both its "buh" sound and its letter "b".
And then it came into English in the 13th century.
About 100 years later, scribes who wrote English but also knew Latin, started to reinsert the "b" into the word's spelling, even though no one pronounced it that way.
But why would they do this?
Why would anyone in their right mind reinsert a silent letter into a spelling?
Well, because they knew Latin, the scribes understood that the root of "doubt" had a "b" in it.
Over time, even as fewer literate people knew Latin, the "b" was kept because it marked important, meaningful connections to other related words, like "dubious" and "indubitalbly," which were subsequently borrowed into English from the same Latin root, "dubitare".
Understanding these historical connections not only helped us to spell "doubt," but also to understand the meaning of these more sophisticated words.
But the story does n't end there.
If we look even deeper, we can see beyond the shadow of a doubt, just how revealing that "b" can be.
There are only two base words in all of English that have the letters "d - o - u - b": one is doubt, and the other is double.
We can build lots of other words on each of these bases, like doubtful and doubtless, or doublet, and redouble, and doubloon.
It turns out that if we look into their history, we can see that they both derive from the same Latin forms.
The meaning of double, two, is reflected in a deep understanding of doubt.
See, when we doubt, when we hesitate, we second guess ourselves.
When we have doubts about something, when we have questions or confusion, we are of two minds.
Historically, before English began to borrow words from French, it already had a word for doubt.
That Old English word was "tweogan," a word whose relationship to "two" is clear in its spelling as well.
So the next time you are in doubt about why English spelling works the way it does, take a second look.
What you find just might make you do a double - take.
Sunning themselves on rocks or waddling awkwardly across the beach, it's easy to think of these immobile mammals less as sea lions, and more as sea house cats.
But do n't be fooled by their beachside behavior.
Under the waves, sea lions are incredible endurance hunters.
Hurtling around at speeds from 4 to 18 miles an hour and hunting for up to 30 hours at a time, these majestic mammals live up to their name.
And thanks to a suite of physical adaptations, finely tuned over millions of years, they make for resourceful foragers.
To find their favorite food, sea lions hunt much deeper than many of their semi-aquatic peers.
With some species diving to depths of nearly 400 meters, they're able to cope with the mounting pressure by collapsing their pliable rib cage, and compressing a pair of springy lungs.
This pushes air up through the smaller airways, collapsing rings of cartilage as oxygen travels out from the lungs, to be held in the larger, upper airways.
Upon surfacing, this air will be used to re-inflate the lungs, but for now their heart slows down to preserve oxygen.
Blood flow is redirected towards only the most essential organs like the heart, lungs, and brain, which rely on reserve oxygen stored in blood and muscle.
Once they arrive at their hunting ground, sea lions depend on their superior vision to find their prey.
Most mammal eyes have a structure called a lens – a transparent, convex structure whose shape refracts light to enable sight.
In humans, this lens is curved to process light waves traveling through air.
But sea lions need to see their best at hundreds of meters deep.
To accommodate, their eyes have a much rounder lens to refract light underwater, as well as teardrop - shaped pupils which can expand to 25 times their original size.
This lets in as much light as possible, helping them pinpoint their prey in even the dimmest conditions.
But once they've closed in, they rely on something akin to a sixth sense to actually catch their meal.
Their whiskers, or vibrissae, are composed of keratin and full of nerve fibers that run deep into the connective tissue of their face.
Sea lions have full directional control over these whiskers, which can lie flat against their face, or stick out at a 90 - degree angle.
When properly tuned, these whiskers can sense the slim trails of moving water fish leave in their wake.
And they're precise enough to let blindfolded sea lions tell the difference between objects less than two centimeters different in size.
With these tools a healthy sea lion can catch generous helpings of fish such as anchovy, mackerel, and squid on every outing.
And with their exceptional memories, they can remember multiple hunting grounds, including those they have n't visited in decades.
This memory also extends to breeding territories and birthing areas, as well as which neighbors are friend and foe.
There's even evidence that sea lions can remember how to perform tasks after 10 years with no practice in between, letting them navigate old stomping grounds with ease.
Yet despite these incredible adaptations, there are changes unfolding in their habitats too rapidly for sea lions to handle.
As climate change warms the oceans, certain toxic algae species thrive.
This algae is harmless to the fish who eat it, but for the sea lions which ingest those fish, the algae's domoic acid can trigger seizures and brain damage.
Changing ocean conditions keep this algae blooming year round, causing more and more sea lions to wash up on beaches.
These red flags help us take action to protect ourselves and other maritime mammals.
And the more we can learn about the changing ocean that sea lions inhabit, the better equipped we'll be to help these clever creatures thrive.
Along the ancient path of the Monongahela River, Braddock, Pennsylvania sits in the eastern region of Allegheny County, approximately nine miles outside of Pittsburgh.
An industrial suburb, Braddock is home to Andrew Carnegie's first steel mill, the Edgar Thomson Works.
Operating since 1875, it is the last functioning steel mill in the region.
For 12 years, I have produced collaborative portraits, still lifes, landscapes and aerial views in order to build a visual archive to address the intersection of the steel industry, the environment, and the health care system's impact on the bodies of my family and community.
The tradition and grand narrative of Braddock is mostly comprised of stories of industrialists and trade unions.
Currently, the new narrative about Braddock, a poster child for Rust Belt revitalization, is a story of urban pioneers discovering a new frontier.
Mass media has omitted the fact that Braddock is predominantly black.
Our existence has been co-opted, silenced and erased.
Fourth generation in a lineage of women, I was raised under the protection and care of Grandma Ruby, off 8th Street at 805 Washington Avenue.
She worked as a manager for Goodwill.
Mom was a nurse's aid.
She watched the steel mills close and white flight to suburban developments.
By the time my generation walked the streets, disinvestment at the local, state and federal level, eroded infrastructure, and the War on Drugs dismantled my family and community.
Grandma Ruby's stepfather Gramps was one of few black men to retire from Carnegie's mill with his pension.
He worked in high temperatures, tearing down and rebuilding furnaces, cleaning up spilt metal and slag.
The history of a place is written on the body and the landscape.
Areas of heavy truck traffic, exposure to benzene and atomized metals, risk cancer and lupus.
One hundred twenty - three licensed beds, 652 employees, rehabilitation programs decimated.
A housing discrimination lawsuit against Allegheny County removed where the projects Talbot Towers once stood.
Recent rezoning for more light industry has since appeared.
Google Maps and Google Earth pixelations conceal the flammable waste being used to squeeze the Bunn family off their home and land.
In 2013, I chartered a helicopter with my cameras to document this aggressive dispossession.
In flight, my observation reveals thousands of plastic white bundles owned by a conservation industry that claims it's eco-friendly and recycles millions of tires to preserve people's lives and to improve people's lives.
My work spirals from the micro to the macro level, excavating hidden histories.
Recently, at the Seattle Art Museum, Isaac Bunn and I mounted this exhibition, and the exhibition was used as a platform to launch his voice.
Through reclamation of our narrative, we will continue to fight historic erasure and socioeconomic inequality.
Mastering any physical skill, be it performing a pirouette, playing an instrument, or throwing a baseball, takes practice.
Practice is the repetition of an action with the goal of improvement, and it helps us perform with more ease, speed, and confidence.
So what does practice do in our brains to make us better at things?
Our brains have two kinds of neural tissue: grey matter and white matter.
The grey matter processes information in the brain, directing signals and sensory stimuli to nerve cells, while white matter is mostly made up of fatty tissue and nerve fibers.
In order for our bodies to move, information needs to travel from the brain's grey matter, down the spinal cord, through a chain of nerve fibers called axons to our muscles.
So how does practice or repetition affect the inner workings of our brains?
The axons that exist in the white matter are wrapped with a fatty substance called myelin.
Myelin is similar to insulation on electrical cables.
It prevents energy loss from electrical signals that the brain uses, moving them more efficiently along neural pathways.
Some recent studies in mice suggest that the repetition of a physical motion increases the layers of myelin sheath that insulates the axons.
And the more layers, the greater the insulation around the axon chains, forming a sort of superhighway for information connecting your brain to your muscles.
So while many athletes and performers attribute their successes to muscle memory, muscles themselves do n't really have memory.
Rather, it may be the myelination of neural pathways that gives these athletes and performers their edge with faster and more efficient neural pathways.
There are many theories that attempt to quantify the number of hours, days, and even years of practice that it takes to master a skill.
While we do n't yet have a magic number, we do know that mastery is n't simply about the amount of hours of practice.
It's also the quality and effectiveness of that practice.
Effective practice is consistent, intensely focused, and targets content or weaknesses that lie at the edge of one's current abilities.
So if effective practice is the key, how can we get the most out of our practice time?
Try these tips.
Focus on the task at hand.
Minimize potential distractions by turning off the computer or TV and putting your cell phone on airplane mode.
In one study, researchers observed 260 students studying.
On average, those students were able to stay on task for only six minutes at a time.
Laptops, smartphones, and particularly Facebook were the root of most distractions.
Coordination is built with repetitions, whether correct or incorrect.
If you gradually increase the speed of the quality repetitons, you have a better chance of doing them correctly.
Next, frequent repetitions with allotted breaks are common practice habits of elite performers.
Studies have shown that many top athletes, musicians, and dancers spend 50 - 60 hours per week on activities related to their craft.
Many divide their time used for effective practice into multiple daily practice sessions of limited duration.
And finally, practice in your brain in vivid detail.
It's a bit surprising, but a number of studies suggest that once a physical motion has been established, it can be reinforced just by imagining it.
In one study, 144 basketball players were divided into two groups.
Group A physically practiced one - handed free throws while Group B only mentally practiced them.
When they were tested at the end of the two week experiment, the intermediate and experienced players in both groups had improved by nearly the same amount.
As scientists get closer to unraveling the secrets of our brains, our understanding of effective practice will only improve.
In the meantime, effective practice is the best way we have of pushing our individual limits, achieving new heights, and maximizing our potential.
Despite a serene sunset on the Dnipro river, the mood is tense for the Zaporozhian Cossacks.
The year is 1676, and the Treaty of Żurawno has officially ended hostilities between the Polish - Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire.
But as Stepan and his men ride towards their stronghold, peace is far from their minds.
Having made their home in the Wild Fields north of the Black Sea, these cossacks - derived from a Turkic word for "free man" - are renowned as one of Europe's most formidable military forces.
Composed of hunters, fishermen, nomads and outlaws, the Cossacks found freedom in these fertile unclaimed lands.
Yet this freedom has proven increasingly difficult to maintain.
Their decades - long strategy of shifting alliances between Poland and Moscow has led to the partitioning of their lands.
In a desperate bid to reclaim independence and reunite the fractured Cossack state, their most recent leader, hetman Petro Doroshenko allied with the Ottoman Empire.
This alliance successfully freed the Zaporozhian Cossacks in the west from Polish dominion, but their victory was a bitter one.
Doroshenko's Ottoman allies ravaged the countryside, carrying off peasants into slavery.
And outrage at allying with Muslims against fellow Christians cost him any remaining local support.
Now, with Doroshenko deposed and exiled, the Cossacks are at odds, disagreeing on what their next move should be.
Until then, Stepan must keep order.
With his musket and curved saber, he cuts an imposing figure.
He surveys his battalion of 180 men.
Most are Orthodox Christians and speak a Slavic language that will become modern Ukrainian.
But there are also Greeks, Tatars, and even some Mongolian Kalmyks, many with different opinions on recent events.
Officially, all of Stepan's men have sworn to uphold the Cossack code by undergoing seven years of military training and remaining unmarried.
In practice, some are part - timers, holding more closely to their own traditions, and maintaining families in nearby villages, outside Cossack lands.
Thankfully, the tenuous peace is not broken before they reach the Sich- the center of Cossack military life.
Currently located at Chortomlyk, the Sich's location shifts with the tide of military action.
The settlement is remarkably well - organized, with administrative buildings, officers' quarters, and even schools, as Cossacks prize literacy.
Stepan and his men make their way to the barracks where they live and train alongside several other battalions or kurins, all of which make up a several hundred man regiment.
Inside, the men dine on dried fish, sheep's cheese, and salted pork fat- along with plenty of wine.
Stepan instructs his friend Yuri to lighten the mood with his bandura.
But before long, an argument has broken out.
One of his men has raised a toast to Doroshenko.
Stepan cuts him off.
The room is silent until he raises his own toast to Ivan Sirko, the new hetman who favors an alliance with Moscow against the Turks.
Stepan plans to support him, and he expects his men to do the same.
Suddenly, one of Sirko's men rushes in, calling an emergency Rada, or general council meeting.
Stepan and the others make their way towards the church square- the center of Sich life.
Ivan Sirko welcomes the confused crowd with exciting news - scouts have located a large Ottoman camp completely vulnerable on one side.
Sirko vows that tomorrow, they will ride against their common enemy, defend the Cossacks' autonomy, and bring unity to the Wild Fields.
As the men cheer in unison, Stepan is relieved at their renewed sense of brotherhood.
Over the next 200 years, these freedom fighters would take on many foes.
And tragically, they would eventually become the oppressive hand of the Russian government they once opposed.
But today, these 17th century Cossacks are remembered for their spirit of independence and defiance.
As the Russian painter Ilya Repin once said: "No people in the world held freedom, equality, and fraternity so deeply."
Hephaestus, god of technology, was hard at work on his most ingenious invention yet.
He was creating a new defense system for King Minos, who wanted fewer intruders on his island kingdom of Crete.
But mortal guards and ordinary weapons would n't suffice, so the visionary god devised an indomitable new defender.
In the fires of his forge, Hephaestus cast his invention in the shape of a giant man.
Made of gleaming bronze; endowed with superhuman strength, and powered by ichor, the life fluid of the gods, this automaton was unlike anything Hephaestus had forged before.
The god named his creation Talos: the first robot.
Three times a day, the bronze guardian marched around the island's perimeter searching for interlopers.
When he identified ships approaching the coast, he hurled massive boulders into their path.
If any survivors made it ashore, he would heat his metal body red -hot and crush victims to his chest.
But despite his robotic behavior, he possessed an internal life his victims could scarcely imagine.
And soon, the behemoth would encounter a ship of invaders that would test his mettle.
The bedraggled crew of Jason, Medea, and the Argonauts were returning from their hard - won quest to retrieve the Golden Fleece.
Their adventure had taken many dark turns, and the weary sailors were desperate to rest in a safe harbor.
They'd heard tales of Crete's invulnerable bronze colossus, and made for a sheltered cove.
But before they could even drop anchor, Talos spotted them.
While the Argonauts cowered at the approach of the awesome automaton, the sorceress Medea spotted a glinting bolt on the robot's ankle- and devised a clever gambit.
Medea offered Talos a bargain: she claimed that she could make Talos immortal in exchange for removing the bolt.
Medea's promise resonated deep within his core.
Unaware of his own mechanical nature, and human enough to long for eternal life, Talos agreed.
While Medea muttered incantations, Jason removed the bolt.
As Medea suspected, the bolt was a weak point in Hephaestus' design.
The ichor flowed out like molten lead, draining Talos of his power source.
The robot collapsed with a thunderous crash, and the Argonauts were free to travel home.
This story, first recorded in roughly 700 BCE, raises some familiar anxieties about artificial intelligence- and even provides an ancient blueprint for science fiction.
But according to historians, ancient robots were more than just myths.
By the 4th century BCE, Greek engineers began making actual automatons including robotic servants and flying models of birds.
None of these creations were as famous as Talos, who appeared on Greek coins, vase paintings, public frescoes, and in theatrical performances.
Even 2,500 years ago, Greeks had already begun to investigate the uncertain line between human and machine.
And like many modern myths about artificial intelligence, Talos' tale is as much about his robotic heart as it is about his robotic brain.
Illustrating the demise of Talos on a vase of the fifth century BCE, one painter captured the dying automaton's despair with a tear rolling down his bronze cheek.
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Children Do."
I do n't have children.
I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt.
I'm Gever Tulley.
I'm a contract computer scientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something called the Tinkering School.
It's a summer program which aims to help kids learn how to build the things that they think of.
So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools into the hands of second - graders.
So if you're thinking about sending your kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised, scraped and bloody.
(Laughter) You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations.
There does n't seem to be any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get.
We put suffocation warnings on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item in the United States.
We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot.
And we seem to think that any item sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10.
So where does this trend stop?
When we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it.
So, as the boundaries of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller, we cut off our children from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact with the world around them.
And despite all of our best efforts and intentions, kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can, in whatever environment they can.
(Laughter) So despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety, and about some simple things that we can do to raise our kids to be creative, confident and in control of the environment around them.
And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress.
The book is called "50 Dangerous Things."
This is "Five Dangerous Things."
Thing number one: Play with fire.
Learning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child's personal history.
Whether we remember it or not, it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things.
These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity to play with it.
So, playing with fire.
This is like one of the great things we ever discovered, fire.
From playing with it, they learn some basic principles about fire, about intake, combustion, exhaust.
These are the three working elements of fire that you have to have for a good, controlled fire.
And you can think of the open - pit fire as a laboratory.
(Laughter) Number two: Own a pocketknife.
Pocketknives are kind of drifting out of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing.
(Laughter) Your first pocketknife is like the first universal tool that you're given.
You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah.
And it's a powerful and empowering tool.
And in a lot of cultures they give knives -- like, as soon as they're toddlers, they have knives.
These are Inuit children cutting whale blubber.
I first saw this in a Canadian Film Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives.
And it shows that kids can develop an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age.
You lay down a couple of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body, keep the blade sharp, never force it -- and these are things kids can understand and practice with.
And yeah, they're going to cut themselves.
I have some terrible scars on my legs from where I stabbed myself.
But you know, they're young.
They heal fast.
(Laughter) Number three: Throw a spear.
It turns out that our brains are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you do n't use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time.
But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength to the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too.
So practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability.
And throwing is a combination of analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind of whole - body training.
These kinds of target - based practices also help kids develop attention and concentration skills, so those are great.
Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances.
There is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher.
Next time you're about to throw out an appliance, do n't throw it out.
Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school, and we'll take it apart with them.
Even if you do n't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them.
And that means that eventually, they can understand all of them.
So these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually complex things made by other people, and you can understand them.
Number five: Two - parter.
Break the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
(Laughter) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case, digital media.
It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3, and play it on your very same computer.
You've just broken a law.
Technically, the RIAA could come and prosecute you.
It's an important lesson for kids to understand, that some of these laws get broken by accident, and that laws have to be interpreted.
That's something we often talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things and breaking them open, and taking them apart and using them for other things.
And also when we go out and drive a car.
Driving a car is a really empowering act for a young child, so this is the alternate -- (Laughter) For those of you who are n't comfortable actually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child.
This is a great stage for a kid.
This happens about the same time that they get latched onto things like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world, that they're trying to get a grip on.
A car is a similar object, and they can get in a car and drive it.
And that really gives them a handle on a world in a way that they do n't often have access to.
And it's perfectly legal.
Find a big empty lot, make sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property, and let them drive your car.
It's very safe actually.
And it's fun for the whole family.
(Laughter) Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half.
I've been playing TED for nearly a decade, and I've very rarely played any new songs of my own.
And that was largely because there were n't any.
(Laughter) So I've been busy with a couple of projects, and one of them was this: The Nutmeg.
A 1930s ship's lifeboat, which I've been restoring in the garden of my beach house in England.
And, so now, when the polar ice caps melt, my recording studio will rise up like an ark, and I'll float off into the drowned world like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel.
During the day, the Nutmeg collects energy from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse, and from a 450 watt turbine up the mast.
So that when it gets dark, I've got plenty of power.
And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon.
And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning, and I work on new songs.
I'd like to play to you guys, if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it.
(Applause) It's about Billie Holiday.
And it appears that, some night in 1947 she left her physical space and was missing all night, until she reappeared in the morning.
But I know where she was.
She was with me on my lifeboat.
And she was hot.
In 2003, when we sequenced the human genome, we thought we would have the answer to treat many diseases.
But the reality is far from that, because in addition to our genes, our environment and lifestyle could have a significant role in developing many major diseases.
One example is fatty liver disease, which is affecting over 20 percent of the population globally, and it has no treatment and leads to liver cancer or liver failure.
So sequencing DNA alone does n't give us enough information to find effective therapeutics.
On the bright side, there are many other molecules in our body.
In fact, there are over 100,000 metabolites.
Metabolites are any molecule that is supersmall in their size.
Known examples are glucose, fructose, fats, cholesterol -- things we hear all the time.
Metabolites are involved in our metabolism.
They are also downstream of DNA, so they carry information from both our genes as well as lifestyle.
Understanding metabolites is essential to find treatments for many diseases.
I've always wanted to treat patients.
Despite that, 15 years ago, I left medical school, as I missed mathematics.
Soon after, I found the coolest thing: I can use mathematics to study medicine.
Since then, I've been developing algorithms to analyze biological data.
So, it sounded easy: let's collect data from all the metabolites in our body, develop mathematical models to describe how they are changed in a disease and intervene in those changes to treat them.
Then I realized why no one has done this before: it's extremely difficult.
(Laughter) There are many metabolites in our body.
For some metabolites, we can measure their molecular mass using mass spectrometry instruments.
But because there could be, like, 10 molecules with the exact same mass, we do n't know exactly what they are, and if you want to clearly identify all of them, you have to do more experiments, which could take decades and billions of dollars.
So we developed an artificial intelligence, or AI, platform, to do that.
We leveraged the growth of biological data and built a database of any existing information about metabolites and their interactions with other molecules.
We combined all this data as a meganetwork.
Then, from tissues or blood of patients, we measure masses of metabolites and find the masses that are changed in a disease.
But, as I mentioned earlier, we do n't know exactly what they are.
A molecular mass of 180 could be either the glucose, galactose or fructose.
They all have the exact same mass but different functions in our body.
Our AI algorithm considered all these ambiguities.
It then mined that meganetwork to find how those metabolic masses are connected to each other that result in disease.
And because of the way they are connected, then we are able to infer what each metabolite mass is, like that 180 could be glucose here, and, more importantly, to discover how changes in glucose and other metabolites lead to a disease.
This novel understanding of disease mechanisms then enable us to discover effective therapeutics to target that.
So we formed a start - up company to bring this technology to the market and impact people's lives.
Now my team and I at ReviveMed are working to discover therapeutics for major diseases that metabolites are key drivers for, like fatty liver disease, because it is caused by accumulation of fats, which are types of metabolites in the liver.
As I mentioned earlier, it's a huge epidemic with no treatment.
And fatty liver disease is just one example.
Moving forward, we are going to tackle hundreds of other diseases with no treatment.
And by collecting more and more data about metabolites and understanding how changes in metabolites leads to developing diseases, our algorithms will get smarter and smarter to discover the right therapeutics for the right patients.
And we will get closer to reach our vision of saving lives with every line of code.
When I was 11, I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house.
My father was listening to BBC News on his small, gray radio.
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then, because the news mostly depressed him.
"The Taliban are gone!" my father shouted.
I did n't know what it meant, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"You can go to a real school now," he said.
A morning that I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed to be outside alone, to a secret school.
It was the only way we both could be educated.
Each day, we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going.
We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us packed in one small living room.
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer.
We all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
From time to time, the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious.
We always wondered what they knew about us.
Were we being followed?
Do they know where we live?
We were scared, but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan, he insisted that his daughter, my mom, go to school, and for that he was disowned by his father.
But my educated mother became a teacher.
There she is.
She retired two years ago, only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father -- that's him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education.
There was no question that his children would receive an education, including his daughters, despite the Taliban, despite the risks.
To him, there was greater risk in not educating his children.
During Taliban years, I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future.
I would want to quit, but my father, he would say, "Listen, my daughter, you can lose everything you own in your life.
Your money can be stolen.
You can be forced to leave your home during a war.
But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees, we will.
So do you still not want to continue? "
Today I am 22.
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school, and had my family not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College.
(Applause) When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters, was among the first to congratulate me.
He not only brags about my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul.
(Applause) My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me.
That's why I am a global ambassador for 10 x 10, a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded SOLA, the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity.
And I see their parents and their fathers who, like my own, advocate for them, despite and even in the face of daunting opposition.
Like Ahmed.
That's not his real name, and I can not show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village, and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes.
As he arrived home, the phone rang, a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try again.
"Kill me now, if you wish," he said, "but I will not ruin my daughter's future because of your old and backward ideas."
What I've come to realize about Afghanistan, and this is something that is often dismissed in the West, that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success.
It's not to say that our mothers are n't key in our success.
In fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters, but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan, we must have the support of men.
Under the Taliban, girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan.
(Applause) Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes.
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal.
But when I am back in Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them, who encourage them, I see a promising future and lasting change.
To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities, and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that.
Like me, they are dreaming big.
In 1991 I had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life.
I was in the third year of my seven - year undergraduate degree.
I took a couple victory laps in there.
And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California, and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus, and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains.
And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise, and as we sat there, over the mountains coming in from the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds rolling toward us, and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley, so help me God, every single animal in that place stopped making noise at the same time.
(Whoosh) This electric hush, as if they could sense what was about to happen.
And then the clouds came over us, and then, boom!
This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain.
It was just extraordinary, and when I came back home I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz, and decided to set it to music, a piece for choir called "Cloudburst," which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment.
Now fast forward to just three years ago.
(Music) And we released to YouTube this, the Virtual Choir Project, 185 singers from 12 different countries.
You can see my little video there conducting these people, alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home.
﻿Two years ago, on this very stage, we premiered Virtual Choir 2, 2,052 singers from 58 different countries, this time performing a piece that I had written called "Sleep."
And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir 3, "Water Night," another piece that I had written, this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries.
(Music) And when I was speaking to Chris about the future of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this, he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could.
Could we do this all in real time?
Could we have people singing together in real time?
And with the help of Skype, that is what we are going to attempt today.
Now, we'll perform "Cloudburst" for you.
The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage.
I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach, Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College, some of the best amateur choirs in the country, and - (Applause) -- and in the second half of the piece, the virtual choir will join us, 30 different singers from 30 different countries.
Now, we've pushed the technology as far as it can go, but there's still less than a second of latency, but in musical terms, that's a lifetime.
So what I've done is, I've adapted "Cloudburst" so that it embraces the latency and the performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together.
So with deep humility, and for your approval, we present "Cloudburst."
(Applause) (Piano) [The rain...]
[Eyes of shadow - water] [eyes of well - water] [eyes of dream - water.]
[Blue suns, green whirlwinds,] [birdbeaks of light pecking open] [pomegranate stars.]
[But tell me, burnt earth, is there no water?]
[Only blood, only dust,] [only naked footsteps on the thorns?]
[The rain awakens...]
[We must sleep with open eyes,] [we must dream with our hands,] [we must dream the dreams of a river seeking it s course,] [of the sun dreaming its worlds.]
[We must dream aloud,] [we must sing till the song puts forth roots,] [trunk, branches, birds, stars.]
[We must find the lost word,] [and remember what the blood,] [the tides, the earth, and the body say,] [and return to the point of departure...]
(Music) (Applause) ["Cloudburst" Octavio Paz] [translation by Lysander Kemp, adapted by Eric Whitacre] Eric Whitacre: Beth.
Annabelle, where are you?
(Applause) Thank you.
I'm an artist and a dad -- second time around.
And I want to share with you my latest art project.
It's a children's book for the iPad.
It's a little quirky and silly.
It's called "Pop - It," And it's about the things little kids do with their parents.
(Music) So this is about potty training -- as most of you, I hope, know.
You can tickle the rug.
You can make the baby poop.
You can do all those fun things.
You can burst bubbles.
You can draw, as everyone should.
But you know, I have a problem with children's books: I think they're full of propaganda.
At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books in Park Slope, forget it.
It's not the way I was brought up.
So I said, "I'm going to counter this with my own propaganda."
If you notice carefully, it's a homosexual couple bringing up a child.
You do n't like it?
Shake it, and you have a lesbian couple.
(Laughter) Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple.
You know, I do n't even believe in the concept of an ideal family.
I have to tell you about my childhood.
I went to this very proper Christian school taught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters.
Basically, I was brought up to be a good Samaritan, and I am.
And I'd go at the end of the day to a traditional Hindu house, which was probably the only Hindu house in a predominantly Islamic neighborhood.
Basically, I celebrated every religious function.
In fact, when there was a wedding in our neighborhood, all of us would paint our houses for the wedding.
I remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani.
(Laughter) We all had to fast during Ramadan.
It was a very beautiful time.
But I must say, I'll never forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened.
Babri Masjid -- one of the most beautiful mosques in India, built by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century -- was demolished by Hindu activists.
This caused major riots in my city.
And for the first time, I was affected by this communal unrest.
My little five - year - old kid neighbor comes running in, and he says, "Rags, Rags.
You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims.
Be careful. "
I'm like, "Dude, I'm Hindu."
(Laughter) He's like, "Huh!"
You know, my work is inspired by events such as this.
Even in my gallery shows, I try and revisit historic events like Babri Masjid, distill only its emotional residue and image my own life.
Imagine history being taught differently.
Remember that children's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change?
I have another idea.
It's a children's book about Indian independence -- very patriotic.
But when you shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective.
Shake it again, and you get the British perspective.
(Applause) You have to separate fact from bias, right.
Even my books on children have cute, fuzzy animals.
But they're playing geopolitics.
They're playing out Israel - Palestine, India - Pakistan.
You know, I'm making a very important argument.
And my argument [is] that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage.
After all, children's books are manuals on parenting, so you better give them children's books that teach them perspectives.
And conversely, only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them.
I'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy.
You know, I ca n't promise my child a life without bias -- we're all biased -- but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives.
In the 1600s, there were so many right whales in Cape Cod Bay off the east coast of the U.S.
that apparently you could walk across their backs from one end of the bay to the other.
Today, they number in the hundreds, and they're endangered.
Like them, many species of whales saw their numbers drastically reduced by 200 years of whaling, where they were hunted and killed for their whale meat, oil and whale bone.
We only have whales in our waters today because of the Save the Whales movement of the '70s.
It was instrumental in stopping commercial whaling, and was built on the idea that if we could n't save whales, what could we save?
It was ultimately a test of our political ability to halt environmental destruction.
So in the early '80s, there was a ban on commercial whaling that came into force as a result of this campaign.
Whales in our waters are still low in numbers, however, because they do face a range of other human - induced threats.
Unfortunately, many people still think that whale conservationists like myself do what we do only because these creatures are charismatic and beautiful.
This is actually a disservice, because whales are ecosystem engineers.
They help maintain the stability and health of the oceans, and even provide services to human society.
So let's talk about why saving whales is critical to the resiliency of the oceans.
It boils down to two main things: whale poop and rotting carcasses.
As whales dive to the depths to feed and come up to the surface to breathe, they actually release these enormous fecal plumes.
This whale pump, as it's called, actually brings essential limiting nutrients from the depths to the surface waters where they stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, which forms the base of all marine food chains.
So really, having more whales in the oceans pooping is really beneficial to the entire ecosystem.
Whales are also known to undertake some of the longest migrations of all mammals.
Gray whales off America migrate 16,000 kilometers between productive feeding areas and less productive calving, or birthing, areas and back every year.
As they do so, they transport fertilizer in the form of their feces from places that have it to places that need it.
So clearly, whales are really important in nutrient cycling, both horizontally and vertically, through the oceans.
But what's really cool is that they're also really important after they're dead.
As these carcasses sink, they provide a feast to some 400 - odd species, including the eel - shaped, slime - producing hagfish.
So over the 200 years of whaling, when we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans, we likely altered the rate and geographic distribution of these whale falls that would descend into deep oceans, and as a result, probably led to a number of extinctions of species that were most specialized and dependent on these carcasses for their survival.
Whale carcasses are also known to transport about 190,000 tons of carbon, which is the equivalent of that produced by 80,000 cars per year from the atmosphere to the deep oceans, and the deep oceans are what we call "carbon sinks," because they trap and hold excess carbon from the atmosphere, and therefore help to delay global warming.
Sometimes these carcasses also wash up on beaches and provide a meal to a number of predatory species on land.
The 200 years of whaling was clearly detrimental and caused a reduction in the populations of whales between 60 to 90 percent.
Clearly, the Save the Whales movement was instrumental in preventing commercial whaling from going on, but we need to revise this.
We need to address the more modern, pressing problems that these whales face in our waters today.
Amongst other things, we need to stop them from getting plowed down by container ships when they're in their feeding areas, and stop them from getting entangled in fishing nets as they float around in the ocean.
We also need to learn to contextualize our conservation messages, so people really understand the true ecosystem value of these creatures.
So, let's save the whales again, but this time, let's not just do it for their sake.
Let's also do it for ours.
First place I'd like to take you is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss.
And I say believe because this process is still ongoing.
Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that I'll talk a little bit about.
One of the things that's changed here, in the last 150 years since Jules Verne had great science - fiction concepts of what the underworld was like, is that technology has enabled us to go to these places that were previously completely unknown and speculated about.
We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity.
Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight.
When you go on a thing like this, we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months, with a team as small as 20 or 30, to as big as 150.
And a lot of people ask me, you know, what kind of people do you get for a project like this?
While our selection process is not as rigorous as NASA, it's nonetheless thorough.
We're looking for competence, discipline, endurance, and strength.
In case you're wondering, this is our strength test.
(Laughter) But we also value esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict while under great stress in remote locations.
We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance.
From the entrance, this is nothing like a commercial cave.
You're looking at Camp Two in a place called J2, not K2, but J2.
We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point.
And it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse, except that you're now running a string of these things down.
The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort while you're down there, otherwise in damp, moist, cold conditions in utterly dark places.
I should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way, is artificially illuminated at great effort.
Otherwise it is completely dark in these places.
The deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water.
It's basically like a tree collecting water coming down.
And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just do n't do justice.
So I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s.
So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico.
(Video) Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous.
We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film.
(Laughter) Along that same line, I have to tell you that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year, we have never seen monsters underground -- at least the kind that eat you.
If there is a monster underground, it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance.
Next year I'll be leading an international team to J2.
We're going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters -- that's a little over 8,600 feet down -- at 30 kilometers from the entrance.
The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight.
I do n't think there's been a mission like that in a long time.
Eventually, if you keep going down in these things, probability says that you're going to run into a place like this.
It's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum that collects water and fills to the roof.
And when you used to find these things, they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon.
Now I remember that term really well for two reasons.
Number one, it's the name of my rock band, and second, is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor.
And we've since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this.
This is some life - support equipment closed - cycle.
And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater.
When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA.
It's like doing extra-vehicular activity in space, but at much greater distances, and at much greater physical peril.
So it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range, away from a safe haven.
Here's a clip from a National Geographic movie that came out in 1999.
(Video) Narrator: Exploration is a physical process of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before.
This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet.
To experience it is a privilege.
Bill Stone: That was taken in Wakulla Springs, Florida.
Couple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment that you saw in there did not exist before 1999.
It was developed within a two - year period and used on actual exploratory projects.
This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper, and it produced the first three - dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs.
It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door to another unexplored world.
This is Europa.
Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day.
This is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there.
For those who have never seen this story, Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie couple of years ago, called "Aliens of the Deep."
There was a brief clip -- (Video) Narrator: A mission to explore under the ice of Europa would be the ultimate robotic challenge.
Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light, it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle.
It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice.
Now we have to get through the ice.
You need a melt probe.
It's basically a nuclear - heated torpedo.
The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep.
Week after week, the melt probe will sink of its own weight through the ancient ice, until finally -- Now, what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean?
You need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle.
It needs to be one smart puppy, able to navigate and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean.
BS: What Jim did n't know when he released that movie was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV.
I mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design and system integration, and introduced DEPTHX -- Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer.
And as the movie says, this is one smart puppy.
It's got 96 sensors, 36 onboard computers, 100,000 lines of behavioral autonomy code, packs more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent.
This is the target site, the world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico.
It's been explored to a depth of 292 meters and beyond that nobody knows anything.
This is part of DEPTHX's mission.
There are two primary targets we're doing here.
One is, how do you do science autonomy underground?
How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist?
There are more stages involved here than I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive through the space, we populate it with environmental variables -- sulphide, halide, things like that.
We calculate gradient surfaces, and drive the bot over to a wall where there's a high probability of life.
We move along the wall, in what's called proximity operations, looking for changes in color.
If we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope.
If it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection.
We either draw in a liquid sample, or we can actually take a solid core from the wall.
No hands at the wheel.
This is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own.
The real hat trick for this vehicle, though, is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed, known as 3D SLAM, for simultaneous localization and mapping.
DEPTHX is an all - seeing eyeball.
It s sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time, allowing it to do new exploration while it's still achieving geometric sensor - lock on what it's gone through already.
What I'm going to show you next is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground that's ever been done.
This May, we're going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton, and if we're very lucky, DEPTHX will bring back the first robotically - discovered division of bacteria.
The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then, if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go, we could potentially launch by 2016, and by 2019 we may have the first evidence of life off this planet.
What then of manned space exploration?
The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024.
The successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientists and pilots.
It will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago.
Something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime.
What I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas.
And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here.
There are three underpinnings of working in space privately.
One of them is the requirement for economical earth - to - space transport.
The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world have got this in their sights and I salute them.
Go, go, go.
The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit.
Orbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on.
The final missing piece, the real paradigm - buster, is this: a gas station on orbit.
It's not going to look like that.
If it existed, it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning.
Now, to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement, I've got to give you the basics of Space 101.
And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram.
Anybody drink one of these here this week?
You'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit.
That's more than you pay for TED, if Google dropped their sponsorship.
(Laughter) The second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant.
Thus, every time you'd want to do anything in space, you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator.
Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics.
So, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price?
There is a place where you can.
In fact, you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower if you can find propellant on the moon.
There is a little - known mission that was launched by the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine.
And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon.
That signal was so strong, it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water buried in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material.
If we're going to get that, and make that gas station possible, we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space.
We ca n't do that right now.
The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground, and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces.
We have to beat that.
We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics.
We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything.
This is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989, with Dr. Lowell Wood's group.
And we can extend that now to just about everything.
Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit.
We can go much further.
We can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water.
There's another thing.
When you're coming back from the moon, you have to deal with orbital mechanics.
It says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station.
You got two choices.
You can burn rocket fuel to get there, or you can do something really incredible.
You can dive into the stratosphere, and precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station.
It has never been done.
It's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride -- better than Disney.
The traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency.
If you try to do that for the moon, you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there.
But if you send a mining team there, without the return propellant, first -- (Laughter) Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez?
This is not like that.
I'm much more like Scotty.
I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it so we're not going to burn the gear.
But, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it, and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done.
There's a myth that you ca n't do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years.
In seven years, we could pull off an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low - earth orbit.
We're living in one of the most exciting times in history.
We're at a magical confluence where private wealth and imagination are driving the demand for access to space.
The orbital refueling stations I've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration.
To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed.
We can do it by jump - starting with an industrial Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater, to mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit.
Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities of purpose and timing.
I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED.
I intend to lead that expedition.
(Applause) It can be done in seven years with the right backing.
Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who, had they been here today, would have heartily approved.
There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier.
We have collectively forgotten that lesson.
Now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward.
100 years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words, I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space frontier, in our time, for all of us.
My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the starry skies with the Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali.
And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian epic "The Mahabharata."
So back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky.
Now we do the same with airplanes.
Back then, when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince, when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow, he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out.
Now we do the same with drills and machines.
The conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery.
And this made me really sad.
I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe.
I was terrified by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends.
And it felt like technology should enable magic, not kill it.
When I was a little girl, my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.
And this piece of 50 - year - old technology became the most magical thing to me.
It became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks and images in my imagination.
So I felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming.
They stopped us from being inspired.
And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology, to see how I could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it.
I've been illustrating books since I was 16.
And so when I saw the iPad, I saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world.
It can know how we're holding it.
It can know where we are.
It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch.
Storytelling is becoming more and more multi-sensorial.
But what are we doing with it?
So I'm actually just going to go in and launch Khoya, an interactive app for the iPad.
So it says, "Place your fingers upon each light."
And so -- (Music) It says, "This box belongs to..."
And so I type in my name.
And actually I become a character in the book.
At various points, a little letter drops down to me -- and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS -- which is actually addressed to me.
The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities.
Now I've been talking a lot about magic.
And I do n't mean wizards and dragons, I mean the kind of childhood magic, those ideas that we all harbored as children.
This idea of fireflies in a jar, for some reason, was always really exciting to me.
And so over here you need to tilt your iPad, take the fireflies out.
And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book.
Another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble.
And so over here, each book and each world becomes a little marble that I drag in to this magical device within the device.
And it opens up a map.
All along, all fantasy books have always had maps, but these maps have been static.
This is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book.
It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well.
So I'm just going to enter in.
Another thing that's actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very contemporary.
Over here, these are the Apsaras.
So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs, but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counterparts, the Apsaras?
These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years in an old and musty book.
And so we're bringing them back in a contemporary story for children.
And a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis.
(Music) Speaking of the environmental crisis, I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms, glued to their PCs, they have n't been able to get out.
But now with mobile technology, we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is that you're sent off on this quest where you need to go outside, take out your camera on the iPad and collect pictures of different natural objects.
When I was a child, I had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells.
And somehow kids do n't do that anymore.
So in bringing back this childhood ritual, you need to go out and, in one chapter, take a picture of a flower and then tag it.
In another chapter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that.
And what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online.
A child in London puts up a picture of a fox and says, "Oh, I saw a fox today."
A child in India says, "I saw a monkey today."
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you've actually taken.
In the possibilities of linking together magic, the earth and technology, there are multiple possibilities.
In the next book, we plan on having an interaction where you take your iPad out with the video on and through augmented reality, you see this layer of animated pixies appear on a houseplant that's outside your house.
At one point, your screen is filled up with leaves.
And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book.
We're moving, we're all moving here, to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology, and magic and technology can come closer together.
We're harnessing energy from the sun.
We're bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story.
Many of us have lost family, friends or loved ones to this horrible disease.
I know there are some of you in the audience who are cancer survivors, or who are fighting cancer at this moment.
My heart goes out to you.
While this word often conjures up emotions of sadness and anger and fear, I bring you good news from the front lines of cancer research.
The fact is, we are starting to win the war on cancer.
In fact, we lie at the intersection of the three of the most exciting developments within cancer research.
The first is cancer genomics.
The genome is a composition of all the genetic information encoded by DNA in an organism.
In cancers, changes in the DNA called mutations are what drive these cancers to go out of control.
Around 10 years ago, I was part of the team at Johns Hopkins that first mapped the mutations of cancers.
We did this first for colorectal, breast, pancreatic and brain cancers.
And since then, there have been over 90 projects in 70 countries all over the world, working to understand the genetic basis of these diseases.
Today, tens of thousands of cancers are understood down to exquisite molecular detail.
The second revolution is precision medicine, also known as "personalized medicine."
Instead of one - size - fits - all methods to be able to treat cancers, there is a whole new class of drugs that are able to target cancers based on their unique genetic profile.
Today, there are a host of these tailor - made drugs, called targeted therapies, available to physicians even today to be able to personalize their therapy for their patients, and many others are in development.
The third exciting revolution is immunotherapy, and this is really exciting.
Scientists have been able to leverage the immune system in the fight against cancer.
For example, there have been ways where we find the off switches of cancer, and new drugs have been able to turn the immune system back on, to be able to fight cancer.
In addition, there are ways where you can take away immune cells from the body, train them, engineer them and put them back into the body to fight cancer.
Almost sounds like science fiction, does n't it?
While I was a researcher at the National Cancer Institute, I had the privilege of working with some of the pioneers of this field and watched the development firsthand.
It's been pretty amazing.
Today, over 600 clinical trials are open, actively recruiting patients to explore all aspects in immunotherapy.
While these three exciting revolutions are ongoing, unfortunately, this is only the beginning, and there are still many, many challenges.
Let me illustrate with a patient.
Here is a patient with a skin cancer called melanoma.
It's horrible; the cancer has gone everywhere.
However, scientists were able to map the mutations of this cancer and give a specific treatment that targets one of the mutations.
And the result is almost miraculous.
Tumors almost seem to melt away.
Unfortunately, this is not the end of the story.
A few months later, this picture is taken.
The tumor has come back.
The question is: Why?
The answer is tumor heterogeneity.
Even a cancer as small as one centimeter in diameter harbors over a hundred million different cells.
While genetically similar, there are small differences in these different cancers that make them differently prone to different drugs.
So even if you have a drug that's highly effective, that kills almost all the cells, there is a chance that there's a small population that's resistant to the drug.
This ultimately is the population that comes back, and takes over the patient.
So then the question is: What do we do with this information?
Well, the key, then, is to apply all these exciting advancements in cancer therapy earlier, as soon as we can, before these resistance clones emerge.
The key to cancer and curing cancer is early detection.
And we intuitively know this.
Finding cancer early results in better outcomes, and the numbers show this as well.
For example, in ovarian cancer, if you detect cancer in stage four, only 17 percent of the women survive at five years.
However, if you are able to detect this cancer as early as stage one, over 92 percent of women will survive.
But the sad fact is, only 15 percent of women are detected at stage one, whereas the vast majority, 70 percent, are detected in stages three and four.
We desperately need better detection mechanisms for cancers.
The current best ways to screen cancer fall into one of three categories.
First is medical procedures, which is like colonoscopy for colon cancer.
Second is protein biomarkers, like PSA for prostate cancer.
Or third, imaging techniques, such as mammography for breast cancer.
Medical procedures are the gold standard; however, they are highly invasive and require a large infrastructure to implement.
Protein markers, while effective in some populations, are not very specific in some circumstances, resulting in high numbers of false positives, which then results in unnecessary work - ups and unnecessary procedures.
Imaging methods, while useful in some populations, expose patients to harmful radiation.
In addition, it is not applicable to all patients.
For example, mammography has problems in women with dense breasts.
So what we need is a method that is noninvasive, that is light in infrastructure, that is highly specific, that also does not have false positives, does not use any radiation and is applicable to large populations.
Even more importantly, we need a method to be able to detect cancers before they're 100 million cells in size.
Does such a technology exist?
Well, I would n't be up here giving a talk if it did n't.
I'm excited to tell you about this latest technology we've developed.
Central to our technology is a simple blood test.
The blood circulatory system, while seemingly mundane, is essential for you to survive, providing oxygen and nutrients to your cells, and removing waste and carbon dioxide.
Here's a key biological insight: Cancer cells grow and die faster than normal cells, and when they die, DNA is shed into the blood system.
Since we know the signatures of these cancer cells from all the different cancer genome sequencing projects, we can look for those signals in the blood to be able to detect these cancers early.
So instead of waiting for cancers to be large enough to cause symptoms, or for them to be dense enough to show up on imaging, or for them to be prominent enough for you to be able to visualize on medical procedures, we can start looking for cancers while they are relatively pretty small, by looking for these small amounts of DNA in the blood.
First, like I said, we start off with a simple blood test -- no radiation, no complicated equipment -- a simple blood test.
Then the blood is shipped to us, and what we do is extract the DNA out of it.
While your body is mostly healthy cells, most of the DNA that's detected will be from healthy cells.
However, there will be a small amount, less than one percent, that comes from the cancer cells.
Then we use molecular biology methods to be able to enrich this DNA for areas of the genome which are known to be associated with cancer, based on the information from the cancer genomics projects.
We're able to then put this DNA into DNA - sequencing machines and are able to digitize the DNA into A's, C's, T's and G's and have this final readout.
Ultimately, we have information of billions of letters that output from this run.
We then apply statistical and computational methods to be able to find the small signal that's present, indicative of the small amount of cancer DNA in the blood.
So does this actually work in patients?
Well, because there's no way of really predicting right now which patients will get cancer, we use the next best population: cancers in remission; specifically, lung cancer.
The sad fact is, even with the best drugs that we have today, most lung cancers come back.
The key, then, is to see whether we're able to detect these recurrences of cancers earlier than with standard methods.
We just finished a major trial with Professor Charles Swanton at University College London, examining this.
Let me walk you through an example of one patient.
Here's an example of one patient who undergoes surgery at time point zero, and then undergoes chemotherapy.
Then the patient is under remission.
He is monitored using clinical exams and imaging methods.
Around day 450, unfortunately, the cancer comes back.
The question is: Are we able to catch this earlier?
During this whole time, we've been collecting blood serially to be able to measure the amount of ct DNA in the blood.
So at the initial time point, as expected, there's a high level of cancer DNA in the blood.
However, this goes away to zero in subsequent time points and remains negligible after subsequent points.
However, around day 340, we see the rise of cancer DNA in the blood, and eventually, it goes up higher for days 400 and 450.
Here's the key, if you've missed it: At day 340, we see the rise in the cancer DNA in the blood.
That means we are catching this cancer over a hundred days earlier than traditional methods.
This is a hundred days earlier where we can give therapies, a hundred days earlier where we can do surgical interventions, or even a hundred days less for the cancer to grow or a hundred days less for resistance to occur.
For some patients, this hundred days means the matter of life and death.
We're really excited about this information.
Because of this assignment, we've done additional studies now in other cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer and ovarian cancer, and I ca n't wait to see how much earlier we can find these cancers.
Ultimately, I have a dream, a dream of two vials of blood, and that, in the future, as part of all of our standard physical exams, we'll have two vials of blood drawn.
And from these two vials of blood we will be able to compare the DNA from all known signatures of cancer, and hopefully then detect cancers months to even years earlier.
Even with the therapies we have currently, this could mean that millions of lives could be saved.
And if you add on to that recent advancements in immunotherapy and targeted therapies, the end of cancer is in sight.
The next time you hear the word "cancer," I want you to add to the emotions: hope.
Hold on.
Cancer researchers all around the world are working feverishly to beat this disease, and tremendous progress is being made.
This is the beginning of the end.
We will win the war on cancer.
And to me, this is amazing news.
Have you ever wondered what happens to a painkiller, like ibuprofen, after you swallow it?
Medicine that slides down your throat can help treat a headache, a sore back, or a throbbing sprained ankle.
But how does it get where it needs to go in the first place?
The answer is that it hitches a ride in your circulatory blood stream, cycling through your body in a race to do it s job before it's snared by organs and molecules designed to neutralize and expel foreign substances.
This process starts in your digestive system.
Say you swallow an ibuprofen tablet for a sore ankle.
Within minutes, the tablet starts disintegrating in the acidic fluids of your stomach.
The dissolved ibuprofen travels into the small intestine and then across the intestinal wall into a network of blood vessels.
These blood vessels feed into a vein, which carries the blood, and anything in it, to the liver.
The next step is to make it through the liver.
As the blood and the drug molecules in it travel through liver blood vessels, enzymes attempt to react with the ibuprofen molecules to neutralize them.
The damaged ibuprofen molecules, called metabolites, may no longer be effective as painkillers.
At this stage, most of the ibuprofen makes it through the liver unscathed.
It continues its journey out of the liver, through veins, into the body's circulatory system.
Half an hour after you swallow the pill, some of the dose has already made it into the circulatory blood stream.
This blood loop travels through every limb and organ, including the heart, brain, kidneys, and back through the liver.
When ibuprofen molecules encounter a location where the body's pain response is in full swing, they bind to specific target molecules that are a part of that reaction.
Painkillers, like ibuprofen, block the production of compounds that help the body transmit pain signals.
As more drug molecules accumulate, the pain - cancelling affect increases, reaching a maximum within about one or two hours.
Then the body starts efficiently eliminating ibuprofen, with the blood dose decreasing by half every two hours on average.
When the ibuprofen molecules detach from their targets, the systemic blood stream carries them away again.
Back in the liver, another small fraction of the total amount of the drug gets transformed into metabolites, which are eventually filtered out by the kidneys in the urine.
The loop from liver to body to kidneys continues at a rate of about one blood cycle per minute, with a little more of the drug neutralized and filtered out in each cycle.
These basic steps are the same for any drug that you take orally, but the speed of the process and the amount of medicine that makes it into your blood stream varies based on drug, person, and how it gets into the body.
The dosing instructions on medicine labels can help, but they're averages based on a sample population that does n't represent every consumer.
And getting the dose right is important.
If it's too low, the medicine wo n't do its job.
If it's too high, the drug and its metabolites can be toxic.
That's true of any drug.
One of the hardest groups of patients to get the right dosage for are children.
That's because how they process medicine changes quickly, as do their bodies.
For instance, the level of liver enzymes that neutralize medication highly fluctuates during infancy and childhood.
And that's just one of many complicating factors.
Genetics, age, diet, disease, and even pregnancy influence the body's efficiency of processing medicine.
Some day, routine DNA tests may be able to dial in the precise dose of medicine personalized to your liver efficiency and other factors, but in the meantime, your best bet is reading the label or consulting your doctor or pharmacist, and taking the recommended amounts with the recommended timing.
For the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy, and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk.
I'll try to spin a story about energy, and oil's a convenient starting place.
The talk will be broadly about energy, but oil's a good place to start.
And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff.
You take about eight or so carbon atoms, about 20 hydrogen atoms, you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid: very energy - dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels.
It's great stuff.
Now, as far as it goes, there's a lot of oil out there in the world.
Here's my little pocket map of where it's all located.
A bigger one for you to look at.
But this is it, this is the oil in the world.
Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is.
This is about 100 trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today.
Now, that's just one story about oil, and we could end it there and say, "Well, oil's going to last forever because, well, there's just a lot of it."
But there's actually more to the story than that.
Oh, by the way, if you think you're very far from some of this oil, 1000 meters below where you're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world.
Come talk to me about it, I'll fill in some of the details if you want.
So, that's one of the stories of oil; there's just a lot of it.
But what about oil?
Where is it in the energy system?
Here's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil, and it's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years.
Now, here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about: For the last 25 years, oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems.
There was one kind of peak oil in 1985, when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply.
Now, it's about 35 percent.
It's been declining and I believe it will continue to decline.
Gasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in 2007 and is declining.
So oil is playing a less significant role every year.
And so, 25 years ago, there was a peak oil; just like, in the 1920s, there was a peak coal; and a hundred years before that, there was a peak wood.
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems.
And what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades?
Well, a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear, for starters.
And what goes on in the future?
Well, I think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas, and beyond that, peak renewables.
Now, I'll tell you another little, very important story about this picture.
Now, I'm not pretending that energy use in total is n't increasing, it is -- that's another part of the story.
Come talk to me about it, we'll fill in some of the details -- but there's a very important message here: This is 200 years of history, and for 200 years we've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system.
Energy systems of the world becoming progressively -- year on year, decade on decade, century on century -- becoming less carbon intense.
And that continues into the future with the renewables that we're developing today, reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy by mid century.
Now that might be the end of the story -- Okay, we just replace it all with conventional renewables -- but I think, actually, there's more to the story than that.
And to tell the next part of the story -- and this is looking out say 2100 and beyond.
What is the future of truly sustainable, carbon - free energy?
Well, we have to take a little excursion, and we'll start in central Texas.
Here's a piece of limestone.
I picked it up outside of Marble Falls, Texas.
It's about 400 million years old.
And it's just limestone, nothing really special about it.
Now, here's a piece of chalk.
I picked this up at MIT.
It's a little younger.
And it's different than this limestone, you can see that.
You would n't build a building out of this stuff, and you would n't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this.
Yeah, it's very different -- no, it's not different.
It's not different, it's the same stuff: calcium carbonate, calcium carbonate.
What's different is how the molecules are put together.
Now, if you think that's kind of neat, the story gets really neat right now.
Off the coast of California comes this: It's an abalone shell.
Now, millions of abalone every year make this shell.
Oh, by the way, just in case you were n't already guessing, it's calcium carbonate.
It's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this.
But it's not the same stuff; it's different.
It's thousands of times, maybe 3,000 times tougher than this.
And why?
Because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers, making this beautiful, iridescent mother of pearl.
Very specialized material that the abalone self - assembles, millions of abalone, all the time, every day, every year.
This is pretty incredible stuff.
All the same, what's different?
How the molecules are put together.
Now, what does this have to do with energy?
Here's a piece of coal.
And I'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk.
Now, whether we're talking about fuels or energy carriers, or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells, nature has n't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature did n't need to.
Nature did n't need to because, unlike the abalone shell, the survival of a species did n't depend on building those materials, until maybe now when it might just matter.
So, when we think about the future of energy, imagine what would it be like if instead of this, we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently.
And so that is my story.
The oil will never run out.
It's not because we have a lot of it.
It's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills.
It's because, well, thousands of years ago, people invented ideas -- they had ideas, innovations, technology -- and the Stone Age ended, not because we ran out of stones.
(Laughter) It's ideas, it's innovation, it's technology that will end the age of oil, long before we run out of oil.
Well we all know the World Wide Web has absolutely transformed publishing, broadcasting, commerce and social connectivity, but where did it all come from?
And I'll quote three people: Vannevar Bush, Doug Engelbart and Tim Berners - Lee.
So let's just run through these guys.
This is Vannevar Bush.
Vannevar Bush was the U.S. government's chief scientific adviser during the war.
And in 1945, he published an article in a magazine called Atlantic Monthly.
And the article was called "As We May Think."
And what Vannevar Bush was saying was the way we use information is broken.
We do n't work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth.
The brain works by association.
With one item in its thought, it snaps instantly to the next item.
And the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process.
And so he suggested a machine, and he called it the memex.
And the memex would link information, one piece of information to a related piece of information and so forth.
Now this was in 1945.
A computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking.
And nobody knew anything about it.
So this was before the computer was invented.
And he proposed this machine called the memex.
And he had a platform where you linked information to other information, and then you could call it up at will.
So spinning forward, one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart, and he was a U.S. Air Force officer.
And he was reading it in their library in the Far East.
And he was so inspired by this article, it kind of directed the rest of his life.
And by the mid-60s, he was able to put this into action when he worked at the Stanford Research Lab in California.
He built a system.
The system was designed to augment human intelligence, it was called.
And in a premonition of today's world of cloud computing and softwares of service, his system was called NLS for oN - Line System.
And this is Doug Engelbart.
He was giving a presentation at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in 1968.
What he showed -- he sat on a stage like this, and he demonstrated this system.
He had his head mic like I've got.
And he works this system.
And you can see, he's working between documents and graphics and so forth.
And he's driving it all with this platform here, with a five - finger keyboard and the world's first computer mouse, which he specially designed in order to do this system.
So this is where the mouse came from as well.
So this is Doug Engelbart.
The trouble with Doug Engelbart's system was that the computers in those days cost several million pounds.
So for a personal computer, a few million pounds was like having a personal jet plane; it was n't really very practical.
But spin on to the 80s when personal computers did arrive, then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers.
And my company, OWL built a system called Guide for the Apple Macintosh.
And we delivered the world's first hypertext system.
Apple introduced a thing called HyperCard, and they made a bit of a fuss about it.
They had a 12 - page supplement in the Wall Street Journal the day it launched.
The magazines started to cover it.
Byte magazine and Communications at the ACM had special issues covering hypertext.
We developed a PC version of this product as well as the Macintosh version.
And our PC version became quite mature.
These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s.
You were able to deliver documents, were able to do it over networks.
We developed a system such that it had a markup language based on html.
We called it hml: hypertext markup language.
And the system was capable of doing very, very large documentation systems over computer networks.
So I took this system to a trade show in Versailles near Paris in late November 1990.
And I was approached by a nice young man called Tim Berners - Lee who said, "Are you Ian Ritchie?" and I said, "Yeah."
And he said, "I need to talk to you."
And he told me about his proposed system called the World Wide Web.
And I thought, well, that's got a pretentious name, especially since the whole system ran on his computer in his office.
But he was completely convinced that his World Wide Web would take over the world one day.
And he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it, because his system did n't have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything; it was just plain text.
I thought, well, you know, interesting, but a guy from CERN, he's not going to do this.
So we did n't do it.
In the next couple of years, the hypertext community did n't recognize him either.
In 1992, his paper was rejected for the Hypertext Conference.
In 1993, there was a table at the conference in Seattle, and a guy called Marc Andreessen was demonstrating his little browser for the World Wide Web.
And I saw it, and I thought, yep, that's it.
And the very next year, in 1994, we had the conference here in Edinburgh, and I had no opposition in having Tim Berners - Lee as the keynote speaker.
So that puts me in pretty illustrious company.
There was a guy called Gary Kildall who went flying his plane when IBM came looking for an operating system for the IBM PC, and he was n't there, so they went back to see Bill Gates.
And the 12 publishers who turned down J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, I guess.
On the other hand, there's Marc Andreessen who wrote the world's first browser for the World Wide Web.
And according to Fortune magazine, he's worth 700 million dollars.
But is he happy?
(Laughter) (Applause)
In 1994, Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein coauthored "The Bell Curve," an extremely controversial book which claims that on average, some races are smarter and more likely to succeed than others.
Murray and Herrnstein also suggest that a lack of critical intelligence explains the prominence of violent crime in poor African - American communities.
But Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein are not the only people who think this.
In 2012, a writer, journalist and political commentator named John Derbyshire wrote an article that was supposed to be a non-black version of the talk that many black parents feel they have to give their kids today: advice on how to stay safe.
In it, he offered suggestions such as: "Do not attend events likely to draw a lot of blacks," "Stay out of heavily black neighborhoods" and "Do not act the Good Samaritan to blacks in distress."
And yet, in 2016, I invited John Derbyshire as well as Charles Murray to speak at my school, knowing full well that I would be giving them a platform and attention for ideas that I despised and rejected.
But this is just a further evolution of a journey of uncomfortable learning throughout my life.
When I was 10 years old, my mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mental illness characterized by mood swings and paranoid delusions.
Throughout my life, my mother's rage would turn our small house into a minefield.
Yet, though I feared her rage on a daily basis, I also learned so much from her.
Our relationship was complicated and challenging, and at the age of 14, it was decided that I needed to live apart from her.
But over the years, I've come to appreciate some of the important lessons my mother taught me about life.
She was the first person who spoke to me about learning from the other side.
And she, like me, was born and raised in a family of committed liberal democrats.
Yet, she encouraged me to see the world and the issues our world faces as complex, controversial and ever-changing.
One day, I came across the phrase "affirmative action" in a book I was reading.
And when I asked her what the term meant, she spent what felt like an hour giving me a thorough and thoughtful explanation that would make sense to a small child.
She even made the topic sound at least as interesting as any of my professors have.
She explained the many reasons why people of various political views challenge and support affirmative action, stressing that, while she strongly supported it herself, it was important for me to view the issue as a controversial one with a long history, a questionable future and a host of complicating factors.
While affirmative action can increase the presence of minorities at elite educational institutions, she felt that it could also disadvantage hardworking people of different races from more affluent backgrounds.
My mom wanted me to understand that I should never just write off opinions that I disagreed with or disliked, because there was always something to learn from the perspectives of others, even when doing so might be difficult.
But life at home with my mom was not the only aspect of my journey that has been formative and uncomfortable.
In fourth grade, she decided that I should attend a private school in order to receive the best education possible.
As a black student attending predominantly white private schools, I've encountered attitudes and behaviors that reflected racial stereotypes.
Several of my friends' parents assumed within minutes of meeting me that my best skill was playing basketball.
And it really upset me to think that my race made it harder for them to see me as a student who loved reading, writing and speaking.
Experiences like this motivated me to work tirelessly to disprove what I knew people had assumed.
My mother even said that, in order to put my best foot forward, I had to be patient, alert and excruciatingly well - mannered.
To prove that I belonged, I had to show poise and confidence, the ability to speak well and listen closely.
Only then would my peers see that I deserved to be there as much as they did.
Despite this racial stereotyping and the discomfort I often felt, the learning I gained from other aspects of being at an elite private school were incredibly valuable.
I was encouraged by my teachers to explore my curiosity, to challenge myself in new ways and to deepen my understanding of subjects that fascinated me the most.
And going to college was the next step.
I was excited to take my intellectual drive and interest in the world of ideas to the next level.
I was eager to engage in lively debate with peers and professors and with outside speakers; to listen, to learn and gain a deeper understanding of myself and of others.
While I was fortunate to meet peers and professors who were interested in doing the same thing, my desire to engage with difficult ideas was also met with resistance.
To prepare myself to engage with controversy in the real world, I joined a group that brought controversial speakers to campus.
But many people fiercely opposed this group, and I received significant pushback from students, faculty and my administration.
For many, it was difficult to see how bringing controversial speakers to campus could be valuable, when they caused harm.
And it was disappointing to me facing personal attacks, having my administration cancel speakers and hearing my intentions distorted by those around me.
My work also hurt the feelings of many, and I understood that.
Of course, no one likes being offended, and I certainly do n't like hearing controversial speakers argue that feminism has become a war against men or that blacks have lower IQs than whites.
I also understand that some people have experienced traumatic experiences in their lives.
And for some, listening to offensive views can be like reliving the very traumas that they've worked so hard to overcome.
Many argue that by giving these people a platform, you're doing more harm than good, and I'm reminded of this every time I listen to these points of view and feel my stomach turn.
Yet, tuning out opposing viewpoints does n't make them go away, because millions of people agree with them.
In order to understand the potential of society to progress forward, we need to understand the counterforces.
By engaging with controversial and offensive ideas, I believe that we can find common ground, if not with the speakers themselves, then with the audiences they may attract or indoctrinate.
Through engaging, I believe that we may reach a better understanding, a deeper understanding, of our own beliefs and preserve the ability to solve problems, which we ca n't do if we do n't talk to each other and make an effort to be good listeners.
But soon after I announced that John Derbyshire would be speaking on campus, student backlash erupted on social media.
I was deeply disappointed by this because, as I saw it, there would be nothing that any of my peers or I could do to silence someone who agreed with him in the office environment of our future employers.
I look out at what's happening on college campuses, and I see the anger.
And I get it.
But what I wish I could tell people is that it's worth the discomfort, it's worth listening, and that we're stronger, not weaker, because of it.
When I think about my experiences with uncomfortable learning, and I reflect upon them, I've found that it's been very difficult to change the values of the intellectual community that I've been a part of.
But I do feel a sense of hope when I think about the individual interactions that I've been able to have with students who both support the work that I'm doing and who feel challenged by it and who do not support it.
What I've found is that, while it can be difficult to change the values of a community, we can gain a lot from individual interactions.
While I did n't get to engage with John Derbyshire due to my president's disinvitation, I was able to have dinner with Charles Murray before his talk.
I knew the conversation would be difficult.
And I did n't expect it to be pleasant.
But it was cordial, and I did gain a deeper understanding of his arguments.
I found that he, like me, believed in creating a more just society.
The thing is, his understanding of what justice entailed was very different from my own.
And I found that his understanding of issues like welfare and affirmative action was tied and deeply rooted in his understanding of various libertarian and conservative beliefs, what diminishes and increases their presence in our society.
While he expressed his viewpoints eloquently, I remained thoroughly unconvinced.
But I did walk away with a deeper understanding.
It's my belief that to achieve progress in the face of adversity, we need a genuine commitment to gaining a deeper understanding of humanity.
I'd like to see a world with more leaders who are familiar with the depths of the views of those they deeply disagree with, so that they can understand the nuances of everyone they're representing.
I see this as an ongoing process involving constant learning, and I'm confident that I'll be able to add value down the line if I continue building empathy and understanding through engaging with unfamiliar perspectives.

As a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.
It was this wild place full of color and life, home to these alien - looking, fantastical creatures.
I pictured big sharks ruling the food chain and saw graceful sea turtles dancing across coral reefs.
As a marine biologist turned photographer, I've spent most of my career looking for places as magical as those I used to dream about when I was little.
As you can see, I began exploring bodies of water at a fairly young age.
But the first time I truly went underwater, I was about 10 years old.
And I can still vividly remember furiously finning to reach this old, encrusted cannon on a shallow coral reef.
And when I finally managed to grab hold of it, I looked up, and I was instantly surrounded by fish in all colors of the rainbow.
That was the day I fell in love with the ocean.
Thomas Peschak Conservation Photographer In my 40 years on this planet, I've had the great privilege to explore some of its most incredible seascapes for National Geographic Magazine and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
I've photographed everything from really, really big sharks to dainty ones that fit in the palm of your hand.
I've smelled the fishy, fishy breath of humpback whales feeding just feet away from me in the cold seas off Canada's Great Bear Rainforest.
And I've been privy to the mating rituals of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel.
Everyone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean.
And the pristine seas I used to dream of as a child are becoming harder and harder to find.
They are becoming more compressed and more threatened.
As we humans continue to maintain our role as the leading predator on earth, I've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand.
For a long time, I thought I had to shock my audience out of their indifference with disturbing images.
And while this approach has merits, I have come full circle.
I believe that the best way for me to effect change is to sell love.
I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts and as a photographer, I have the rare opportunity to reveal animals and entire ecosystems that lie hidden beneath the ocean's surface.
You ca n't love something and become a champion for it if you do n't know it exists.
Uncovering this -- that is the power of conservation photography.
(Music) I've visited hundreds of marine locations, but there are a handful of seascapes that have touched me incredibly deeply.
The first time I experienced that kind of high was about 10 years ago, off South Africa's rugged, wild coast.
And every June and July, enormous shoals of sardines travel northwards in a mass migration we call the Sardine Run.
And boy, do those fish have good reason to run.
In hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile predators.
Common dolphins hunt together and they can separate some of the sardines from the main shoal and they create bait balls.
They drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface and then they rush in to dine on this pulsating and movable feast.
Now, most people believe that sharks and dolphins are these mortal enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they actually coexist.
In fact, dolphins actually help sharks feed more effectively.
Without dolphins, the bait balls are more dispersed and sharks often end up with what I call a sardine donut, or a mouth full of water.
Now, while I've had a few spicy moments with sharks on the sardine run, I know they do n't see me as prey.
However, I get bumped and tail - slapped just like any other guest at this rowdy, rowdy banquet.
From the shores of Africa we travel east, across the vastness that is the Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
And during the stormy southwest monsoon, manta rays from all across the archipelago travel to a tiny speck in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
Armies of crustaceans, most no bigger than the size of your pupils, are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.
When plankton concentrations become patchy, manta rays feed alone and they somersault themselves backwards again and again, very much like a puppy chasing its own tail.
(Music) However, when plankton densities increase, the mantas line up head - to - tail to form these long feeding chains, and any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line is surely to be gobbled up by the next or the one after.
As plankton levels peak in the bay, the mantas swim closer and closer together in a unique behavior we call cyclone feeding.
And as they swirl in tight formation, this multi-step column of mantas creates it s own vortex, sucking in and delivering the plankton right into the mantas' cavernous mouths.
The experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays is truly unforgettable.
(Music) When I first photographed Hanifaru, the site enjoyed no protection and was threatened by development.
And working with NGOs like the Manta Trust, my images eventually helped Hanifaru become a marine - protected area.
Now, fisherman from neighboring islands, they once hunted these manta rays to make traditional drums from their skins.
Today, they are the most ardent conservation champions and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy in excess of 8 million dollars every single year.
I have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly blank or they read, "There be dragons."
And today, the closest I've come is visiting remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean.
Far, far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets, diving into these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like.
Very few people have heard of Bassas da India, a tiny speck of coral in the Mozambique Channel.
It s reef forms a protective outer barrier and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day.
I had a bit of a hunch that they'd be even bolder and more abundant at night.
(Music) Never before have I encountered so many sharks on a single coral outcrop.
Capturing and sharing moments like this -- that reminds me why I chose my path.
Earlier this year, I was on assignment for National Geographic Magazine in Baja California.
And about halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side lies San Ignacio Lagoon, a critical calving ground for gray whales.
For 100 years, this coast was the scene of a wholesale slaughter, where more than 20,000 gray whales were killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors.
Today the descendents of these same whales nudge their youngsters to the surface to play and even interact with us.
(Music) This species truly has made a remarkable comeback.
Now, on the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo, a sleepy fishing village.
Decades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse.
In 1995, local fisherman convinced the authorities to proclaim their waters a marine reserve.
But what happened next was nothing short of miraculous.
In 2005, after only a single decade of protection, scientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recorded.
But do n't take my word for it -- come with me.
On a single breath, swim with me in deep, into one of the largest and densest schools of fish I have ever encountered.
(Music) We all have the ability to be creators of hope.
And through my photography, I want to pass on the message that it is not too late for our oceans.
And particularly, I want to focus on nature's resilience in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that in the future, I will have to search much, much harder to make photographs like this, while creating images that showcase our respectful coexistence with the ocean.
Those will hopefully become an everyday occurrence for me.
To thrive and survive in my profession, you really have to be a hopeless optimist.
And I always operate on the assumption that the next great picture that will effect change is right around the corner, behind the next coral head, inside the next lagoon or possibly, in the one after it.
When you hear the word symmetry, maybe you picture a simple geometric shape like a square or a triangle, or the complex pattern on a butterfly's wings.
If you are artistically inclined, you might think of the subtle modulations of a Mozart concerto, or the effortless poise of a prima ballerina.
When used in every day life, the word symmetry represents vague notions of beauty, harmony and balance.
In math and science, symmetry has a different, and very specific, meaning.
In this technical sense, a symmetry is the property of an object.
Pretty much any type of object can have symmetry, from tangible things like butterflies, to abstract entities like geometric shapes.
So, what does it mean for an object to be symmetric?
Here's the definition: a symmetry is a transformation that leaves that object unchanged.
Okay, that sounds a bit abstract, so let's unpack it.
It will help to look at a particular example, like this equilateral triangle.
In this case, the object is the triangle, and the transformation that leaves the object unchanged is rotation through 120 degrees.
So we can say an equilateral triangle is symmetric with respect to rotations of 120 degrees around its center.
If we rotated the triangle by, say, 90 degrees instead, the rotated triangle would look different to the original.
In other words, an equilateral triangle is not symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees around its center.
But why do mathematicians and scientists care about symmetries?
Turns out, they're essential in many fields of math and science.
Let's take a close look at one example: symmetry in biology.
You might have noticed that there's a very familiar kind of symmetry we have n't mentioned yet: the symmetry of the right and left sides of the human body.
The transformation that gives this symmetry is reflection by an imaginary mirror that slices vertically through the body.
As with all symmetries found in living things, it's only approximate, but still a striking feature of the human body.
We humans are n't the only bilaterally symmetric organisms.
Many other animals, foxes, sharks, beetles, that butterfly we mentioned earlier, have this kind of symmetry, as do some plants like orchid flowers.
Other organisms have different symmetries, ones that only become apparent when you rotate the organism around its center point.
It's a lot like the rotational symmetry of the triangle we watched earlier.
But when it occurs in animals, this kind of symmetry is known as radial symmetry.
For instance, some sea urchins and starfish have pentaradial or five - fold symmetry, that is, symmetry with respect to rotations of 72 degrees around their center.
This symmetry also appears in plants, as you can see for yourself by slicing through an apple horizontally.
Some jellyfish are symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees, while sea anemones are symmetric when you rotate them at any angle.
Some corals, on the other hand, have no symmetry at all.
They are completely asymmetric.
But why do organisms exhibit these different symmetries?
Does body symmetry tell us anything about an animal's lifestyle?
Let's look at one particular group: bilaterally symmetric animals.
In this camp, we have foxes, beetles, sharks, butterflies, and, of course, humans.
The thing that unites bilaterally symmetric animals is that their bodies are designed around movement.
If you want to pick one direction and move that way, it helps to have a front end where you can group your sensory organs -- your eyes, ears and nose.
It helps to have your mouth there too since you're more likely to run into food or enemies from this end.
You're probably familiar with a name for a group of organs, plus a mouth, mounted on the front of an animal's body.
It's called a head.
Having a head leads naturally to the development of bilateral symmetry.
And it also helps you build streamlined fins if you're a fish, aerodynamic wings if you're a bird, or well coordinated legs for running if you're a fox.
But, what does this all have to do with evolution?
Turns out, biologists can use these various body symmetries to figure out which animals are related to which.
For instance, we saw that starfish and sea urchins have five - fold symmetry.
But really what we should have said was adult starfish and sea urchins.
In their larval stage, they're bilateral, just like us humans.
For biologists, this is strong evidence that we're more closely related to starfish than we are, to say, corals, or other animals that do n't exhibit bilateral symmetry at any stage in their development.
One of the most fascinating and important problems in biology is reconstructing the tree of life, discovering when and how the different branches diverged.
Thinking about something as simple as body symmetry can help us dig far into our evolutionary past and understand where we, as a species, have come from.
For most jobs, it's understood that you can be fired, whether for crime, incompetence, or just poor performance.
But what if your job happens to be the most powerful position in the country, or the world?
That's where impeachment comes in.
Impeachment is n't the same as actually removing someone from office.
Like an indictment in criminal court, it's only the formal accusation that launches a trial, which could end in conviction or acquittal.
Originating in the United Kingdom, impeachment allowed Parliament to vote for removing a government official from office even without the king's consent.
Although this was an important check on royal power, the king could n't be impeached because the monarch was considered the source of all government power.
But for the founders of the American Republic, there was no higher authority beyond the people themselves.
And so impeachment was adopted in the United States as a power of Congress applying to any civil officers, up to and including the president.
Although demands for impeachment can come from any members of the public, only the House of Representatives has the power to actually initiate the process.
It begins by referring the matter to a committee, usually the House Committee on Rules and the House Committee on the Judiciary.
These committees review the accusations, examine the evidence, and issue a recommendation.
If they find sufficient grounds to proceed, the House holds a separate vote on each of the specific charges, known as Articles of Impeachment.
If one or more passes by a simple majority, the official is impeached and the stage is set for trial.
The actual trial that follows impeachment is held in the Senate.
Selected members of the House, known as managers, act as the prosecution, while the impeached official and their lawyers present their defense.
The Senate acts as both judge and jury, conducting the trial and deliberating after hearing all the arguments.
If it's the president or vice president being impeached, the chief justice of the Supreme Court presides.
A conviction requires a supermajority of two - thirds and results in automatic removal from power.
Depending on the original charges, it can also disqualify them from holding office in the future and open them to standard criminal prosecution.
So what exactly can get someone impeached?
That's a bit more complicated.
Unlike in the United Kingdom, impeachment in the U.S. pits an elected legislature against other democratically elected members of government.
Therefore, to prevent the process from being used as a political weapon, the Constitution specifies that an official can only be impeached for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.
That still leaves a lot of room for interpretation, not to mention politics, and many impeachment trials have split along partisan lines.
But the process is generally understood to be reserved for serious abuses of power.
The first official to be impeached was Tennesse Senator William Blount in 1797 for conspiring with Britain to cease the Spanish colony of Louisiana.
Since then, the House has launched impeachment investigations about 60 times, but only 19 have led to actual impeachment proceedings.
The eight cases that ended in a conviction and removal from office were all federal judges.
And impeachment of a sitting president is even more rare.
Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 for attempting to replace Secretary of War Edwin Stanton without consulting the Senate.
Over a century later, Bill Clinton was impeached for making false statements under oath during a sexual harassment trial.
Both were ultimately acquitted when the Senate's votes to convict fell short of the required two - thirds majority.
And contrary to popular belief, Richard Nixon was never actually impeached for the Watergate scandal.
He resigned before it could happen knowing he would almost certainly be convicted.
Theoretically, the U.S. government is already designed to prevent abuses of power, limiting different branches through a system of checks and balances, term limits, and free elections.
But impeachment can be seen as an emergency brake for when these safeguards fail.
How much would you pay for a bouquet of tulips?
A few dollars?
A hundred dollars?
How about a million dollars?
Well, how much would you pay for this house, or partial ownership of a website that sells pet supplies?
At different points in time, tulips, real estate and stock in pets.com have all sold for much more than they were worth.
In each instance, the price rose and rose and then abruptly plummeted.
Economists call this a bubble.
So what is exactly is going on with a bubble?
Well, let's start with the tulips to get a better idea.
The 17th century saw the Netherlands enter the Dutch golden age.
By the 1630s, Amsterdam was an important port and commercial center.
Dutch ships imported spices from Asia in huge quantities to earn profits in Europe.
So Amsterdam was brimming with wealthy, skilled merchants and traders who displayed their prosperity by living in mansions surrounded by flower gardens.
And there was one flower in particularly high demand: the tulip.
The tulip was brought to Europe on trading vessels that sailed from the East.
Because of this, it was considered an exotic flower that was also difficult to grow, since it could take years for a single tulip to bloom.
During the 1630s, an outbreak of tulip breaking virus made select flowers even more beautiful by lining petals with multicolor, flame - like streaks.
A tulip like this was scarcer than a normal tulip and as a result, prices for these flowers started to rise, and with them, the tulip's popularity.
It was n't long before the tulip became a nationwide sensation and tulip mania was born.
A mania occurs when there is an upward movement of price combined with a willingness to pay large sums of money for something valued much lower in intrinsic value.
A recent example of this is the dot -com mania of the 1990s.
Stocks in new, exciting websites were like the tulips of the 17th century.
The more people who wanted the tulip, the higher the price could go.
At one point, a single tulip bulb sold for more than ten times the annual salary of a skilled craftsman.
In the stock market, the price of stock is based on the supply and demand of investors.
Stock prices tend to rise when it seems like a company will earn more in the future.
Investors might then buy more of the stock, raising the prices even further due to an increased demand.
This can result in a feedback loop where investors get caught up in the hype and ultimately drive prices far above intrinsic value, creating a bubble.
All that is needed for a mania to end and for a bubble to burst is the collective realization that the price of the stock, or a tulip, far exceeds its worth.
That's what happened with both manias.
Suddenly the demand ended.
Prices were pushed to staggering lows, and pop!
The bubbles burst, and the market crashed.
Today, scholars work long and hard trying to predict what causes a bubble and how to avoid them.
Tulip mania is an effective illustration of the underlying principles at work in a bubble and can help us understand more recent examples like the real estate bubble of the late 2000s.
The economy will continue to go through phases of booms and busts.
So while we wait for the next mania to start, and the next bubble to burst, treat yourself to a bouquet of tulips and enjoy the fact that you did n't have to pay an arm and a leg for them.
The future that we will create can be a future that we'll be proud of.
I think about this every day; it's quite literally my job.
I'm co-founder and senior columnist at Worldchanging.com.
Alex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late 2003, and since then we and our growing global team of contributors have documented the ever- expanding variety of solutions that are out there, right now and on the near horizon.
In a little over two years, we've written up about 4,000 items -- replicable models, technological tools, emerging ideas -- all providing a path to a future that's more sustainable, more equitable and more desirable.
Our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional.
There are tons of places to go, online and off, if what you want to find is the latest bit of news about just how quickly our hell - bound handbasket is moving.
We want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it.
We focus primarily on the planet's environment, but we also address issues of global development, international conflict, responsible use of emerging technologies, even the rise of the so - called Second Superpower and much, much more.
The scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad, but that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so.
A quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface, but to give you a sense of what we cover: tools for rapid disaster relief, such as this inflatable concrete shelter; innovative uses of bioscience, such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines; ultra high - efficiency designs for homes and offices; distributed power generation using solar power, wind power, ocean power, other clean energy sources; ultra, ultra high - efficiency vehicles of the future; ultra high - efficiency vehicles you can get right now; and better urban design, so you do n't need to drive as much in the first place; bio-mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings; distributed computing projects that will help us model the future of the climate.
Also, a number of the topics that we've been talking about this week at TED are things that we've addressed in the past on Worldchanging: cradle - to - cradle design, MIT's Fab Labs, the consequences of extreme longevity, the One Laptop per Child project, even Gapminder.
As a born - in - the - mid-1960s Gen X-er, hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday, I'm naturally inclined to pessimism.
But working at Worldchanging has convinced me, much to my own surprise, that successful responses to the world's problems are nonetheless possible.
Moreover, I've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes can really blind you to the very possibility of success.
As Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed, "Pessimism is a luxury of good times...
In difficult times, pessimism is a self - fulfilling, self - inflicted death sentence. "
The truth is, we can build a better world, and we can do so right now.
We have the tools: we saw a hint of that a moment ago, and we're coming up with new ones all the time.
We have the knowledge, and our understanding of the planet improves every day.
Most importantly, we have the motive: we have a world that needs fixing, and nobody's going to do it for us.
Many of the solutions that I and my colleagues seek out and write up every day have some important aspects in common: transparency, collaboration, a willingness to experiment, and an appreciation of science -- or, more appropriately, science!
(Laughter) The majority of models, tools and ideas on Worldchanging encompass combinations of these characteristics, so I want to give you a few concrete examples of how these principles combine in world - changing ways.
We can see world - changing values in the emergence of tools to make the invisible visible -- that is, to make apparent the conditions of the world around us that would otherwise be largely imperceptible.
We know that people often change their behavior when they can see and understand the impact of their actions.
As a small example, many of us have experienced the change in driving behavior that comes from having a real time display of mileage showing precisely how one's driving habits affect the vehicle's efficiency.
The last few years have all seen the rise of innovations in how we measure and display aspects of the world that can be too big, or too intangible, or too slippery to grasp easily.
Simple technologies, like wall - mounted devices that display how much power your household is using, and what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights -- these can actually have a direct positive impact on your energy footprint.
Community tools, like text messaging, that can tell you when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising or a natural disaster is unfolding, can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion.
Data - rich displays like maps of campaign contributions, or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps, allow us to better understand the context and the flow of processes that affect us all.
We can see world - changing values in research projects that seek to meet the world's medical needs through open access to data and collaborative action.
Now, some people emphasize the risks of knowledge - enabled dangers, but I'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge - enabled solutions are far more important.
For example, open - access journals, like the Public Library of Science, make cutting - edge scientific research free to all -- everyone in the world.
And actually, a growing number of science publishers are adopting this model.
Last year, hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers around the world worked together to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible for some of the developing world's worst diseases: African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.
That genome data can now be found on open - access genetic data banks around the world, and it's an enormous boon to researchers trying to come up with treatments.
But my favorite example has to be the global response to the SARS epidemic in 2003, 2004, which relied on worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus.
The U.S. National Research Council in its follow - up report on the outbreak specifically cited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason why the treatment for SARS could be developed so quickly.
And we can see world - changing values in something as humble as a cell phone.
I can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this room who do not use a mobile phone -- and where is Aubrey, because I know he does n't?
(Laughter) For many of us, cell phones have really become almost an extension of ourselves, and we're really now beginning to see the social changes that mobile phones can bring about.
You may already know some of the big - picture aspects: globally, more camera phones were sold last year than any other kind of camera, and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens, and over the network -- and sometimes enter history books.
In the developing world, mobile phones have become economic drivers.
A study last year showed a direct correlation between the growth of mobile phone use and subsequent GDP increases across Africa.
In Kenya, mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative currency.
The political aspects of mobile phones ca n't be ignored either, from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government, to the Blairwatch Project in the UK, keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press.
(Laughter) And it's just going to get more wild.
Pervasive, always - on networks, high quality sound and video, even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket, will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate.
It's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone may be among the world's most important technologies.
And in this rapidly evolving context, it's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes something far more than a medium for social interaction.
I've long admired the Witness project, and Peter Gabriel told us more details about it on Wednesday, in his profoundly moving presentation.
And I'm just incredibly happy to see the news that Witness is going to be opening up a Web portal to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones to send in their recordings over the Internet, rather than just hand - carrying the videotape.
Not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue for documenting abuses, it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation.
Now, imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists.
Imagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence of what's happening to the planet: putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds, from activists and researchers to businesspeople and political figures.
It would highlight the changes that are underway, but would more importantly give voice to the people who are willing to work to see a new world, a better world, come about.
It would give everyday citizens a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet.
It would be, in essence, an "Earth Witness" project.
Now, just to be clear, in this talk I'm using the name "Earth Witness" as part of the scenario, simply as a shorthand, for what this imaginary project could aspire to, not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization.
It could just as easily be called, "Environmental Transparency Project," "Smart Mobs for Natural Security" -- but Earth Witness is a lot easier to say.
Now, many of the people who participate in Earth Witness would focus on ecological problems, human - caused or otherwise, especially environmental crimes and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions.
That's understandable and important.
We need better documentation of what's happening to the planet if we're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage.
But the Earth Witness project would n't need to be limited to problems.
In the best Worldchanging tradition, it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas, successful projects and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility.
Earth Witness would show us two worlds: the world we're leaving behind, and the world we're building for generations to come.
And what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is we could do it today.
The key components are already widely available.
Camera phones, of course, would be fundamental to the project.
And for a lot of us, they're as close as we have yet to always - on, widely available information tools.
You could even imagine a version of this scenario in which people actually build their own phones.
Over the course of last year, open - source hardware hackers have come up with multiple models for usable, Linux - based mobile phones, and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project.
At the other end of the network, there'd be a server for people to send photos and messages to, accessible over the Web, combining a photo - sharing service, social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system.
Now, you Web 2.0 folks in the audience know what I'm talking about, but for those of you for whom that last sentence was in a crazy moon language, I mean simply this: the online part of the Earth Witness project would be created by the users, working together and working openly.
That's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle of what's now happening to our planet, but we could do more.
﻿An Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone.
Now, you do n't see these devices as add - ons for phones yet, but students and engineers around the world have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons -- that being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C. Irvine, using bird - mounted sensors as a way of measuring smog - forming pollution.
It's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing on a phone carried by a person.
Now, the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new: phone - makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath, or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure.
Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical, more seriously, makes a mobile phone add - on that can process blood tests in the field, uploading the data, displaying the results.
Even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act, designing a prototype phone that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs.
Now, there's an enormous variety of tiny, inexpensive sensors on the market, and you can easily imagine someone putting together a phone that could measure temperature, CO2 or methane levels, the presence of some biotoxins -- potentially, in a few years, maybe even H5 N1 avian flu virus.
You could see that some kind of system like this would actually be a really good fit with Larry Brilliant's InSTEDD project.
Now, all of this data could be tagged with geographic information and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis.
And that's worth noting in particular.
The impact of open - access online maps over the last year or two has been simply phenomenal.
Developers around the world have come up with an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps, from bus routes and crime statistics to the global progress of avian flu.
Earth Witness would take this further, linking what you see with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world.
It's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished if something like this ever existed.
We'd have a far better -- far better knowledge of what's happening on our planet environmentally than could be gathered with satellites and a handful of government sensor nets alone.
It would be a collaborative, bottom - up approach to environmental awareness and protection, able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way -- and if you need greater sensor density, just have more people show up.
And most important, you ca n't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth.
This is a system that could put the next generation at the front lines of gathering environmental data.
And as we work to figure out ways to mitigate the worst effects of climate disruption, every little bit of information matters.
A system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of us to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and, ultimately, the improvement of the planet itself.
Now, as I suggested at the outset, there are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there, so why have I spent the bulk of my time telling you about something that does n't exist?
Because this is what tomorrow could look like: bottom - up, technology - enabled global collaboration to handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced.
We can save the planet, but we ca n't do it alone -- we need each other.
Nobody's going to fix the world for us, but working together, making use of technological innovations and human communities alike, we might just be able to fix it ourselves.
We have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models, powerful tools, and innovative ideas that can make a meaningful difference in our planet's future.
We do n't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all; we already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used.
There's a staggering array of wonders out there, across diverse disciplines, all telling us the same thing: success can be ours if we're willing to try.
And as we say at Worldchanging, another world is n't just possible; another world is here.
We just need to open our eyes.
Thank you very much.
It's an incredible discovery: an ancient, abandoned alien space station filled with precursor technology.
But now, every species in the galaxy is in a mad dash to get there first and claim it for themselves.
And right away, you've got a problem.
Your ship's faster - than - light jump drive consumes 1 unit of fuel for every parsec of distance it takes you, and your ship holds only 15 units of fuel.
But the space station is 23 parsecs away, and there's only empty space between there and here.
There's one thing that can help you, though: dark matter fuel is stable in deep space.
That means you can vent a cache of it from your fuel chamber, and then come back to pick it up again later.
Even though your ship holds only 15 units of fuel, you've been granted use of all 45 units in your current location.
With some strategic fuel caching along the way, you might be able to make it all 23 parsecs.
So how can you reach the alien space station?
Answer in 3, 2, 1.
It's possible to solve this riddle using as few as two cache points, and there are also valid solutions that use more.
No matter how you go about it though, the key is determining exactly where to cache fuel along your route.
Let's work backwards from the alien space station.
To reach 23 parsecs, you'll have to leave the 8 - parsec mark with a full tank of fuel.
The 8 - parsec point is too far from the start to use as a cache right away; you could jump there, but would n't have enough fuel to return to the start, let alone store any for later.
So that means you'll need to find a cache somewhere between the start and 8.
But where?
There's an interesting pattern that can help.
At the start you have exactly 3 tanks' worth of fuel.
At 8 parsecs you need exactly 1.
Is there a point, which we can call point X, where you could have exactly 2?
That would be useful, because then you could refuel there exactly twice, making full use of your storage capacity without any waste.
Wherever point X is, you'll jump forward from it twice: once to deposit some fuel at the 8 - parsec cache point, and a second time for good.
So you'll jump the distance between X and 8 - parsecs 3 times in all.
You'd have 2 tanks of fuel at point X, and need 1 left at the 8 parsec cache point, so you can spend one tank -- or 15 units -- going back and forth.
Since 15 units divided by 3 trips is 5, we can place these two cache points 5 parsecs apart.
Any farther, and you would n't have enough fuel to reach the alien space station.
So it looks like the earliest we can place point X is at the 3 - parsec mark.
Is it possible to transport 30 units of fuel there?
Let's try.
You set out with a full tank of 15 units.
You jump 3 parsecs, drop 9 units off at the cache point, and then jump the 3 units home, arriving with an empty tank.
Repeating this process gets you 18 units of fuel at the cache point, and one more jump puts you at the 3 - parsec cache with 30 total units of fuel.
So far so good!
Next, you jump to the 8 - parsec mark, drop off 5 units of fuel, and jump back to the 3 - parsec mark.
You fill up your tank and jump forward again, arriving with 10 units of fuel in your tank.
And now the end is in sight.
You beam the 5 units of fuel in from deep space to fill your tank to capacity, and type in the coordinates of your final destination.
A 15 - parsec jump leaves you running on fumes, but ready to dock with the precursor space station.
Time to put this alien tech to work and make life better for everyone in the galaxy.
Automation anxiety has been spreading lately, a fear that in the future, many jobs will be performed by machines rather than human beings, given the remarkable advances that are unfolding in artificial intelligence and robotics.
What's clear is that there will be significant change.
What's less clear is what that change will look like.
My research suggests that the future is both troubling and exciting.
The threat of technological unemployment is real, and yet it's a good problem to have.
And to explain how I came to that conclusion, I want to confront three myths that I think are currently obscuring our vision of this automated future.
A picture that we see on our television screens, in books, in films, in everyday commentary is one where an army of robots descends on the workplace with one goal in mind: to displace human beings from their work.
And I call this the Terminator myth.
Yes, machines displace human beings from particular tasks, but they do n't just substitute for human beings.
They also complement them in other tasks, making that work more valuable and more important.
Sometimes they complement human beings directly, making them more productive or more efficient at a particular task.
So a taxi driver can use a satnav system to navigate on unfamiliar roads.
An architect can use computer - assisted design software to design bigger, more complicated buildings.
But technological progress does n't just complement human beings directly.
It also complements them indirectly, and it does this in two ways.
The first is if we think of the economy as a pie, technological progress makes the pie bigger.
As productivity increases, incomes rise and demand grows.
The British pie, for instance, is more than a hundred times the size it was 300 years ago.
And so people displaced from tasks in the old pie could find tasks to do in the new pie instead.
But technological progress does n't just make the pie bigger.
It also changes the ingredients in the pie.
As time passes, people spend their income in different ways, changing how they spread it across existing goods, and developing tastes for entirely new goods, too.
New industries are created, new tasks have to be done and that means often new roles have to be filled.
So again, the British pie: 300 years ago, most people worked on farms, 150 years ago, in factories, and today, most people work in offices.
And once again, people displaced from tasks in the old bit of pie could tumble into tasks in the new bit of pie instead.
Economists call these effects complementarities, but really that's just a fancy word to capture the different way that technological progress helps human beings.
Resolving this Terminator myth shows us that there are two forces at play: one, machine substitution that harms workers, but also these complementarities that do the opposite.
Now the second myth, what I call the intelligence myth.
What do the tasks of driving a car, making a medical diagnosis and identifying a bird at a fleeting glimpse have in common?
Well, these are all tasks that until very recently, leading economists thought could n't readily be automated.
And yet today, all of these tasks can be automated.
You know, all major car manufacturers have driverless car programs.
There's countless systems out there that can diagnose medical problems.
And there's even an app that can identify a bird at a fleeting glimpse.
Now, this was n't simply a case of bad luck on the part of economists.
They were wrong, and the reason why they were wrong is very important.
They've fallen for the intelligence myth, the belief that machines have to copy the way that human beings think and reason in order to outperform them.
When these economists were trying to figure out what tasks machines could not do, they imagined the only way to automate a task was to sit down with a human being, get them to explain to you how it was they performed a task, and then try and capture that explanation in a set of instructions for a machine to follow.
This view was popular in artificial intelligence at one point, too.
I know this because Richard Susskind, who is my dad and my coauthor, wrote his doctorate in the 1980s on artificial intelligence and the law at Oxford University, and he was part of the vanguard.
And with a professor called Phillip Capper and a legal publisher called Butterworths, they produced the world's first commercially available artificial intelligence system in the law.
This was the home screen design.
He assures me this was a cool screen design at the time.
(Laughter) I've never been entirely convinced.
He published it in the form of two floppy disks, at a time where floppy disks genuinely were floppy, and his approach was the same as the economists': sit down with a lawyer, get her to explain to you how it was she solved a legal problem, and then try and capture that explanation in a set of rules for a machine to follow.
In economics, if human beings could explain themselves in this way, the tasks are called routine, and they could be automated.
But if human beings ca n't explain themselves, the tasks are called non-routine, and they're thought to be out reach.
Today, that routine - nonroutine distinction is widespread.
Think how often you hear people say to you machines can only perform tasks that are predictable or repetitive, rules - based or well - defined.
Those are all just different words for routine.
And go back to those three cases that I mentioned at the start.
Those are all classic cases of nonroutine tasks.
Ask a doctor, for instance, how she makes a medical diagnosis, and she might be able to give you a few rules of thumb, but ultimately she'd struggle.
She'd say it requires things like creativity and judgment and intuition.
And these things are very difficult to articulate, and so it was thought these tasks would be very hard to automate.
If a human being ca n't explain themselves, where on earth do we begin in writing a set of instructions for a machine to follow?
Thirty years ago, this view was right, but today it's looking shaky, and in the future it's simply going to be wrong.
Advances in processing power, in data storage capability and in algorithm design mean that this routine - nonroutine distinction is diminishingly useful.
To see this, go back to the case of making a medical diagnosis.
Earlier in the year, a team of researchers at Stanford announced they'd developed a system which can tell you whether or not a freckle is cancerous as accurately as leading dermatologists.
It's not trying to copy the judgment or the intuition of a doctor.
It knows or understands nothing about medicine at all.
Instead, it's running a pattern recognition algorithm through 129,450 past cases, hunting for similarities between those cases and the particular lesion in question.
It's performing these tasks in an unhuman way, based on the analysis of more possible cases than any doctor could hope to review in their lifetime.
It did n't matter that that human being, that doctor, could n't explain how she'd performed the task.
Now, there are those who dwell upon that the fact that these machines are n't built in our image.
As an example, take IBM's Watson, the supercomputer that went on the US quiz show "Jeopardy!" in 2011, and it beat the two human champions at "Jeopardy!"
The day after it won, The Wall Street Journal ran a piece by the philosopher John Searle with the title "Watson Does n't Know It Won on 'Jeopardy!'"
Right, and it's brilliant, and it's true.
You know, Watson did n't let out a cry of excitement.
It did n't call up its parents to say what a good job it had done.
It did n't go down to the pub for a drink.
This system was n't trying to copy the way that those human contestants played, but it did n't matter.
It still outperformed them.
Resolving the intelligence myth shows us that our limited understanding about human intelligence, about how we think and reason, is far less of a constraint on automation than it was in the past.
What's more, as we've seen, when these machines perform tasks differently to human beings, there's no reason to think that what human beings are currently capable of doing represents any sort of summit in what these machines might be capable of doing in the future.
Now the third myth, what I call the superiority myth.
It's often said that those who forget about the helpful side of technological progress, those complementarities from before, are committing something known as the lump of labor fallacy.
Now, the problem is the lump of labor fallacy is itself a fallacy, and I call this the lump of labor fallacy fallacy, or LOLFF, for short.
Let me explain.
The lump of labor fallacy is a very old idea.
It was a British economist, David Schloss, who gave it this name in 1892.
He was puzzled to come across a dock worker who had begun to use a machine to make washers, the small metal discs that fasten on the end of screws.
And this dock worker felt guilty for being more productive.
Now, most of the time, we expect the opposite, that people feel guilty for being unproductive, you know, a little too much time on Facebook or Twitter at work.
But this worker felt guilty for being more productive, and asked why, he said, "I know I'm doing wrong.
I'm taking away the work of another man. "
In his mind, there was some fixed lump of work to be divided up between him and his pals, so that if he used this machine to do more, there'd be less left for his pals to do.
Schloss saw the mistake.
The lump of work was n't fixed.
As this worker used the machine and became more productive, the price of washers would fall, demand for washers would rise, more washers would have to be made, and there'd be more work for his pals to do.
The lump of work would get bigger.
Schloss called this "the lump of labor fallacy."
And today you hear people talk about the lump of labor fallacy to think about the future of all types of work.
There's no fixed lump of work out there to be divided up between people and machines.
Yes, machines substitute for human beings, making the original lump of work smaller, but they also complement human beings, and the lump of work gets bigger and changes.
But LOLFF.
Here's the mistake: it's right to think that technological progress makes the lump of work to be done bigger.
Some tasks become more valuable.
New tasks have to be done.
But it's wrong to think that necessarily, human beings will be best placed to perform those tasks.
And this is the superiority myth.
Yes, the lump of work might get bigger and change, but as machines become more capable, it's likely that they'll take on the extra lump of work themselves.
Technological progress, rather than complement human beings, complements machines instead.
To see this, go back to the task of driving a car.
Today, satnav systems directly complement human beings.
They make some human beings better drivers.
But in the future, software is going to displace human beings from the driving seat, and these satnav systems, rather than complement human beings, will simply make these driverless cars more efficient, helping the machines instead.
Or go to those indirect complementarities that I mentioned as well.
The economic pie may get larger, but as machines become more capable, it's possible that any new demand will fall on goods that machines, rather than human beings, are best placed to produce.
The economic pie may change, but as machines become more capable, it's possible that they'll be best placed to do the new tasks that have to be done.
In short, demand for tasks is n't demand for human labor.
Human beings only stand to benefit if they retain the upper hand in all these complemented tasks, but as machines become more capable, that becomes less likely.
So what do these three myths tell us then?
Well, resolving the Terminator myth shows us that the future of work depends upon this balance between two forces: one, machine substitution that harms workers but also those complementarities that do the opposite.
And until now, this balance has fallen in favor of human beings.
But resolving the intelligence myth shows us that that first force, machine substitution, is gathering strength.
Machines, of course, ca n't do everything, but they can do far more, encroaching ever deeper into the realm of tasks performed by human beings.
What's more, there's no reason to think that what human beings are currently capable of represents any sort of finishing line, that machines are going to draw to a polite stop once they're as capable as us.
Now, none of this matters so long as those helpful winds of complementarity blow firmly enough, but resolving the superiority myth shows us that that process of task encroachment not only strengthens the force of machine substitution, but it wears down those helpful complementarities too.
Bring these three myths together and I think we can capture a glimpse of that troubling future.
Machines continue to become more capable, encroaching ever deeper on tasks performed by human beings, strengthening the force of machine substitution, weakening the force of machine complementarity.
And at some point, that balance falls in favor of machines rather than human beings.
This is the path we're currently on.
I say "path" deliberately, because I do n't think we're there yet, but it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this is our direction of travel.
That's the troubling part.
Let me say now why I think actually this is a good problem to have.
For most of human history, one economic problem has dominated: how to make the economic pie large enough for everyone to live on.
Go back to the turn of the first century AD, and if you took the global economic pie and divided it up into equal slices for everyone in the world, everyone would get a few hundred dollars.
Almost everyone lived on or around the poverty line.
And if you roll forward a thousand years, roughly the same is true.
But in the last few hundred years, economic growth has taken off.
Those economic pies have exploded in size.
Global GDP per head, the value of those individual slices of the pie today, they're about 10,150 dollars.
If economic growth continues at two percent, our children will be twice as rich as us.
If it continues at a more measly one percent, our grandchildren will be twice as rich as us.
By and large, we've solved that traditional economic problem.
Now, technological unemployment, if it does happen, in a strange way will be a symptom of that success, will have solved one problem -- how to make the pie bigger -- but replaced it with another -- how to make sure that everyone gets a slice.
As other economists have noted, solving this problem wo n't be easy.
Today, for most people, their job is their seat at the economic dinner table, and in a world with less work or even without work, it wo n't be clear how they get their slice.
There's a great deal of discussion, for instance, about various forms of universal basic income as one possible approach, and there's trials underway in the United States and in Finland and in Kenya.
And this is the collective challenge that's right in front of us, to figure out how this material prosperity generated by our economic system can be enjoyed by everyone in a world in which our traditional mechanism for slicing up the pie, the work that people do, withers away and perhaps disappears.
Solving this problem is going to require us to think in very different ways.
There's going to be a lot of disagreement about what ought to be done, but it's important to remember that this is a far better problem to have than the one that haunted our ancestors for centuries: how to make that pie big enough in the first place.
If you want a glimpse of Marie Curie's manuscripts, you'll have to sign a waiver and put on protective gear to shield yourself from radiation contamination.
Madame Curie's remains, too, were interred in a lead - lined coffin, keeping the radiation that was the heart of her research, and likely the cause of her death, well contained.
Growing up in Warsaw in Russian - occupied Poland, the young Marie, originally named Maria Sklodowska, was a brilliant student, but she faced some challenging barriers.
As a woman, she was barred from pursuing higher education, so in an act of defiance, Marie enrolled in the Floating University, a secret institution that provided clandestine education to Polish youth.
By saving money and working as a governess and tutor, she eventually was able to move to Paris to study at the reputed Sorbonne.
There, Marie earned both a physics and mathematics degree surviving largely on bread and tea, and sometimes fainting from near starvation.
In Paris, Marie met the physicist Pierre Curie, who shared his lab and his heart with her.
But she longed to be back in Poland.
Upon her return to Warsaw, though, she found that securing an academic position as a woman remained a challenge.
All was not lost.
Back in Paris, the lovelorn Pierre was waiting, and the pair quickly married and became a formidable scientific team.
Another physicist's work sparked Marie Curie's interest.
In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium spontaneously emitted a mysterious X - ray - like radiation that could interact with photographic film.
Curie soon found that the element thorium emitted similar radiation.
Most importantly, the strength of the radiation depended solely on the element's quantity, and was not affected by physical or chemical changes.
This led her to conclude that radiation was coming from something fundamental within the atoms of each element.
The idea was radical and helped to disprove the long - standing model of atoms as indivisible objects.
Next, by focusing on a super radioactive ore called pitchblende, the Curies realized that uranium alone could n't be creating all the radiation.
So, were there other radioactive elements that might be responsible?
In 1898, they reported two new elements, Polonium, named for Marie's native Poland, and Radium, the Latin word for ray.
They also coined the term radioactivity along the way.
By 1902, the Curies had extracted a tenth of a gram of pure radium chloride salt from several tons of pitchblende, an incredible feat at the time.
Later that year, Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel were nominated for the Nobel Prize in physics, but Marie was overlooked.
And so both of the Curies and Becquerel shared the 1903 Nobel Prize, making Marie Curie the first female Nobel Laureate.
Well funded and well respected, the Curies were on a roll.
But tragedy struck in 1906 when Pierre was crushed by a horse - drawn cart as he crossed a busy intersection.
Marie, devastated, immersed herself in her research and took over Pierre's teaching position at the Sorbonne, becoming the school's first female professor.
Her solo work was fruitful.
In 1911, she won yet another Nobel, this time in chemistry for her earlier discovery of radium and polonium, and her extraction and analysis of pure radium and its compounds.
This made her the first, and to this date, only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different sciences.
Professor Curie put her discoveries to work, changing the landscape of medical research and treatments.
She opened mobile radiology units during World War I, and investigated radiation's effects on tumors.
However, these benefits to humanity may have come at a high personal cost.
Curie died in 1934 of a bone marrow disease, which many today think was caused by her radiation exposure.
Marie Curie's revolutionary research laid the groundwork for our understanding of physics and chemistry, blazing trails in oncology, technology, medicine, and nuclear physics, to name a few.
For good or ill, her discoveries in radiation launched a new era, unearthing some of science's greatest secrets.
To the world we all know, which may or may not be the best world possible, once again spring time had come.
But all the magical spring was not enough to conceal the misery of Manor Farm.
Once striving and fruitful, the farm and it s owner Mr. Jones had fallen on evil days.
This set by problems of his own making,
Mr. Jones had turned to drink.
And for his misery he had found fine company.
On the evening our story begins, it was later than usual when Mr. Jones came home from drinking to make his rounds.
On this night, all the animals had agreed that as soon as Mr. Jones was in bed, they would gather in the main barn for a secret meeting called by Old Major, the prized boar hog, who because of his years
The other pigs started first for the meeting, being clever and found to taking the lead.
They were followed by Boxer, the largest and strongest of the horses and his devoted friend Benjamin, the donkey.
All the other animals great and small were anxious to get there, for such a meeting has never been held before.
Old Major had been ailing and now he had made known, there were some things he wanted to say to his fellow animals before it might be too late.
It took a while for all to find their seats.
The pigs have taken up the best positions immediately in front of the platform.
Among them, Snowball, determined to get a good view.
And Napoleon, equally determined and even less polite.
No it was n't Mr. Jones.
And at last, everyone could be settled to hear Old Major.
My dear friends, I have lived a long live.
I have had much time to thought as I lay alone in my stall.
I wo n't be with you much longer, and before I die, there is something I want to tell you.
Few of us will ever know the blessings of a peaceful old age.
You Boxer, when you have given the last of your great strength... what then?
Whatever we produce is taken from us, stolen from us, and sold.
Our children are born to cold and hunger.
Look at them while you can.
You porkers, do you know what the future holds for you?
Do we deserve such a fate?
Is this farm too poor to support us all?
When the farm is rich, we would never get our rightful share from Farmer Jones.
Who has only seen your tyrant, and we shall be rich and free!
We animals are brothers.
Large or small, clever or simple, fur or feathers, now and forever, all animals are equal!
The very next morning, sooner perhaps than Old Major would have predicted, the animals found their situation quite unbearable.
And so, almost before they realised it, the animals have fought and won.
They had casualties to mourn, and those who died left children to be cared for.
But Manor Farm was theirs and they lost no time in destroying everything that reminded them of hateful Mr. Jones.
When it came to Mr. Jones' house, the animals hesitated.
Napoleon showed the way, but Snowball took the lead in entering the place where their tyrant had lived.
The animals were all agreed, that Jones' house was no place for them.
All that is, except Napoleon.
Meantime, Snowball lead the other animals in organizing a new society, which they now named Animal Farm.
So that all might see and agree, the laws of Animal Farm where inscribed in a prominent place to be remembered and obeyed forever.
NO ANIMAL SHALL SLEEP IN A BED
NO ANIMAL SHALL DRINK ALCOHOL
FOUR LEGS GOOD TWO LEGS BAD
Wings count as legs.
Four legs good, two legs bad.
Tending farm by themselves posed problems for the animals, but the pigs could figure a way around every difficulty.
Boxer was the admiration of everybody.
He had been a hard worker in Jones' time.
But now he seemed more like three horses in one.
Instructed by Snowball, other animals worked out the rest for themselves.
And the farm work was done like magic.
The success of their efforts delighted everyone, including the sly Napoleon and his constant companion, fat pig Squealer.
That summer the animals, without any help or any interference, made a going proposition of Animal Farm.
The fields yielded richly and they were cut and gleamed with diligence and devotion.
With the harvest safely home, the animals had time to think of the future and at a meeting in the big barn, many resolutions were put forward.
It was always the pigs who made the resolutions.
Comrades, our first five month plan is a farmwide triumph and the time has come to spread the glorious news, so that our downtrodden comrades on other farms will break their chains and join the animal revolution.
Tell them on there's an Animal Farm to the world!
Some animals, content with their luck, were unimpressed by tales of peace and plenty.
Others, happy in their own surroundings, were alarmed of the thought of any change.
But wherever they were having a bad time, animals listened with interest.
In certain quarters, the rebellious behavior of a lot of dumb animals caused indignation, much conversation, but nothing was done about it, for the drunken Mr. Jones and his cronies did not know what to do.
Snowball felt that education was the animals' next necessity.
Some of the animals were brighter than others, of course.
Snowball set himself to solve the problem of power on the farm.
And so did Napoleon.
In January there came bitterly hard weather.
Inexperienced management brought shortages to Animal Farm, but Snowball continued his thinking for the future.
And in such thoughts, he was not alone.
I have prepared a new plan for Animal Farm.
At first, we will have to work more and eat less, but my plan will bring us electricity.
It will mean a warm pound in winter, a light in every stall, sty and roost.
Comrades, in one short year, Animal Farm will be the finest in the world.
A vote for my plan is a vote for a live beautiful.
I promise you a 4 day week.
- Perhaps a 3 day week.
With Snowball disposed of,
Napoleon stepped up confidently to take charge of Animal Farm, and fat pig Squealer became his obedient follower and assistant.
Comrades, Snowball is a traitor.
What was he really planning?
Now let's have no more of these useless meetings.
From now on, I'll protect your interests!
And I'll make your decisions!
Let me show you my plan for Animal Farm.
For legs good, two legs bad.
And so the windmill was started after all.
Nothing could have been achieved without Boxer, whose strength was greater than that of all the other animals put together.
Superintended by the pigs, all the animals worked long shifts which lasted from dawn till dusk.
Rations were shortened for the workers, but the pigs by virtue of their brainwork were plentifully provided for.
But the greatest inspiration came from Boxer, who with his friend Benjamin, worked early and late, in season and out.
One evening after working long and late as usual,
Boxer and Benjamin made a curious discovery.
Word of what now went on at night in Jones' house spread quickly to Animal Farm.
And now, other changes in the laws of Animal Farm were in store.
- Those ungrateful beasts of yours.
They wo n't last...
Another winter will bring them to their knees.
In Mr. Jones' circle the subject of shortages at Animal Farm was a popular one.
And the sharp trader named Whymper was just the sort to do something about it.
Comrades, our leader, as wise as he is beloved, has decided to trade with the outside world.
Not for gain of course, that would be unworthy of our noble principles.
I know how proud you are of this privilege.
The chickens seemed to remember Old Major saying that their eggs should never be taken from them.
The innocent suffered with the guilty and the chicken's uprising was short lived.
Comrades, I have made a terrible discovery.
There are traitors among us.
Yes comrades, in league with Jones and Snowball
to destroy Animal Farm.
Who else is guilty?
Stand up and confess!
The revolution is now complete.
We have no more use for that song.
See it is now forbidden under penalty of death.
Trade between Animal Farm and the outer world now became quite brisk.
As might be expected, Mr. Whymper's profits inspired others to seek their share.
Or at least give vent to their jealousy.
- Animal Farm seems to be making money for Whymper.
- Who ever heard of animals running a farm.
- Have you seen their windmill?
- Come on and let's kick'em out.
- Yes, kick'em out.
The original owner was not invited to join this movement.
His neighbours let him know his day was done.
Comrades, the enemy has mobilised all his forces against us.
We must save Animal Farm from its enemies at all costs we have.
Now is the time to fight, to die for Animal Farm...
Now began the heartbreaking job of rebuilding.
And as before, Boxer and Benjamin worked hardest of all.
By now, supervision of the work by pigs was hardly necessary, so they had time for less laborious pursuits.
Long after the other animals left the job,
Boxer and Benjamin worked on and on, giving their all year in, year out.
A new generation of pigs grew up, endowed with what was considered odds and graces very flattering to Animal Farm and it's presiding genius.
But still the windmill was not finished and Boxer's injured foot got worse instead of better.
It looked as though Boxer were dead but he was n't, not quite.
Boxer is hurt badly, he will never work again.
What do we do?
While Napoleon and Squealer made plans for Boxer,
Benjamin predicted he could look forward to a well earned rest and retirement.
Next day the windmill work went on as usual, but now without Boxer.
And during the morning, what appeared to be an ambulance arrived.
Only Benjamin suspected it was n't an ambulance.
The other animals finally recognised the death wagon from Mr. Whymper's glue factory.
forward comrades, long live Napoleon.
And for the wicked rumour that Boxer was sold to a glue factory our belived leader would never do that.
And that night, the pigs drank to Boxer's memory, and the whisky they had bought with Boxer's life.
Years passed, the seasons came and went.
The short animal lives fled by.
The completed windmill stood as a monument to its builders' fate and sacrifice.
But the animals' revolution was only dimly remembered.
Outwardly Animal Farm appeared prosperous.
But the animals themselves were no better off, with the exception of the pigs and their supreme leader Napoleon.
This pig-run enterprise now had many of the frills of real civilization.
And one fine day, pig delegates from far and wide arrived to Animal Farm to celebrate the coming of a new era.
BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS
When reports of this great change reached them, other animals everywhere were incredulous.
Dismayed and indignant, they headed toward Animal Farm from all directions, instinctively uniting once again in common cause.
On farms owned and operated by the pigs there is order and discipline.
All of the animals do more work and eat less than on other farms.
With this, I will encourage you to make your loyal animals work even harder and eat even less.
To a greater Animal Farm.
To peace and plenty under pig rule.
To the day when pigs own and operate farms everywhere.
To the animals, it now seemed that their world, which may or may not some day become a happy place to live in, was worse than ever for ordinary creatures.
And another moment had come when they must do something about it.
He asked his master...
"Master, are the branches moving or is it the wind?"
Not even glancing to where his pupil was pointing... the master smiled and said...
"It's your heart and mind."
Sunwoo, you should go downstairs for a moment.
There's some trouble.
Okay, I'll handle it.
I'm sorry, but business hours are over.
Please get up and leave before I count to three. One.
Sit down, stupid!
Min - gi, lock the door.
So, did you take care of yesterday's business?
You always seem to get things done.
It looks like Chairman Baek's son is the one making trouble.
Yes, it did n't seem like Chairman Baek did it himself.
I heard he's interested in this business.
There's talk that he started dealings with Southeast Asia.
He's pushing businesses to hire Filipina girls instead of Russians.
Assholes. Like father, like son.
I should n't have brought my car...
I hope I'm not interrupting?
Get another for me.
Hey, sorry about yesterday.
Those guys yesterday were just local boys.
Nothing to worry about, sir.
What do you think you're doing?
Is this how you do business?
- Get out now.
Get out and wait for me!
Things are going good for you now.
But the world is not easy.
You can do 100 things right, but one mistake can destroy everything.
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.
I'll try to sort things out with Chairman Baek.
Anyhow, the real reason I asked you here...
I have a favor to ask before I leave.
Pour me a drink.
Oh, yes, sir.
I have a young girlfriend.
Someone I really care about.
She's not like you and me. She's a special kind of person.
What, am I boring you?
Uh... Congratulations, sir.
Never mind "Congratulations."
The problem is, I think She's seeing a new guy.
It's driving me crazy, and I could n't tell anyone else.
You know, you're the only one I can really talk to about this.
No one else knows how much this worries me.
So, I'd like you to watch Heesoo for just three days.
Watch over her. Take care of her.
See if she's really seeing someone.
Maybe the bastard's just bothering her.
See whether she's given him her body and soul and all.
You know young people, a hand could brush a shoulder... then they hold hands, then kiss, and then... you know...
But I ca n't stand thinking about her like that.
Stupid, is n't it?
So... I want you to find out who she's meeting.
And what she does when they meet.
Just for 3 days.
This is Heesoo's address and phone number.
If they look like they're involved...
Call me right away. Or finish them off yourself.
You know I ca n't stand being lied to, right?
Love is n't love if you're being lied to.
You can contact me here in Shanghai.
Have a good night.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Have you ever been in love?
That's why I'm entrusting you with this job.
That's why I like you.
President Kang told me to give this to you personally.
President Kang told me to give this to you personally.
Do n't you think so?
Hold on a second...
President Kang also said I should drive you today.
- He said I should take you myself.
- I'll let him know about it.
Well, then, I'll see you later.
If you need anything, please contact me here.
It's okay, I do n't need it.
Oh, give it to me anyway.
They sure like to get around...
Maybe it's because they're still young?
Why is n't she getting out?
President Baek, that asshole...
He keeps calling and bothering me.
Asking how could we do this to him.
He says he lost face because of you.
He wants to meet you.
But he insists on meeting you.
He's calling me every 10 minutes.
I think you should... What the...
Who's bugging me now?
You take care of it now.
Hello, this is Kim Sunwoo.
Well, if you have something to say, Come here and tell me yourself. I'm hanging up.
I took care of it.
What a rude bastard. Hello?
Laughing? You think that's funny?
That's why you get your ass kicked.
Damn you bastard, look at me.
Look at me, damn it.
Do you think it's funny?
Funny, funny, funny?
What hell were you thinking?
Hey, this is your job.
I took care of it because you were n't there.
This kind of thing is your job.
You should've taken care of it.
They just want to do business with us and beat us to the punch before starting to deal.
Do n't you get it?
What are you lecturing me now?
Hey, get the phone over here.
Yes sir. Here, sir.
Is this voice dial?
Do n't you think we need to press the numbers?
Should I dial it with my mouth?
You did n't answer your mobile, so I'm leaving this message.
If you have some time, I need your help for a little while.
Just until 3 in the afternoon.
Mr. Kang said you're a scary guy. Excuse me?
You're an enforcer, are n't you?
I gave you my card the other day.
So you're an enforcer for the hotel?
I'm not that kind of person.
You're so boring to talk to.
How did you first meet Mr. Kang?
- Wait a minute.
How much is the red lamp?
- Okay, bye.
What were you saying?
You asked why I am seeing Mr. Kang?
Yes. Why do you want to know?
It's just... you do n't have to answer.
Asking you those questions. It's okay.
I did n't want to eat by myself.
How will you return home?
It's easy to catch a cab here.
Hi, Min -gi.
Someone came to see you early this morning.
Oh Moosung. Do you know him?
I do n't know him. Anything else?
You want to talk to him now?
No, Min- gi, do n't put him through.
Hey, Sunwoo, come over here.
Why do n't you come over here for a second?
Ji-hyun, this is Mr. Kim's seat. Come.
Girls, get out.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry I was rude the other day.
- I guess we had a misunderstanding. - Is that why you came here?
- You be quiet.
Do n't use your people to mess with me anymore.
Damn it, how could you do this to me? I can do this because it's you.
Kim Sunwoo, do you think the world is all yours? Do n't do anything you'll regret.
Are n't you going?
- You go first. - See you.
Stop kidding. Where did you say you'd sleep tonight?
Thanks. How should we do this?
Did you go down to the club?
You know who I'm calling, do n't you?
This is what we'll do.
I'll give you a chance.
Listen. Both of you.
You must never see each other again.
Because this can get more serious than either of you can imagine. No point thinking about it any longer so... You, hurry, get dressed and leave.
- Leave me alone! - Listen to me!
Do you really believe we can just forget about what happened here tonight?
- This... - Do you... really... think so?
I was just looking for the best way out of this. Okay, you can go now.
I do n't have anything else to say. You understand I ca n't say anything, right?
Should I thank you for saving my life or something?
Please leave now. I'll do as you say.
That's not the way it is.
You know it ca n't be erased.
Hey, open the window.
What's wrong with that guy?
I'm sick of talking.
I only came to give you a message.
Did Mr. Baek send you?
"I. Was. Wrong." Three little words.
If you say those three words, nothing horrible will happen.
"I. Was. Wrong." Just three words.
Everyone's got to live their life.
Are n't you going to answer the phone?
It's okay, it's not important.
Would you like some coffee?
No, it's okay. I have to go soon.
You look pretty upset.
No, I'm ok.
But I'm moving out.
I put this house up for sale.
Do you know why I like you? It's because you do n't care what other people think.
I used to think you were to young. But I still come to see you, like today.
And you still make me look for you. That's what I like about you.
Being young is a gift, too.
As you get older, you lose patience.
What's a great guy like you doing in a place like this, huh?
Do you know what you're doing now?
Do n't waste time, just get rid of him.
Where's the cocky Mr. Kim now?
Smile, like a professional. Smile.
We'll never forget about this.
You have no idea what's happening.
Why'd you do it?
Why did n't you just call me?
It's not like you.
So what was the reason?
Do n't feel like talking?
Want it to end like this?
The world's a funny place.
No one can ever see what's coming next.
What are you going to do?
Relax and just sit tight.
The boss is giving you a chance.
Why did n't you tell me?
Why did you make that mistake?
If the two of them never meet again... Go on.
If they can keep that promise, I thought it would be best. No... not that kind of thing. Tell me the real reason.
Was it because of her?
You ca n't say?
Put Moon back on.
Hey, what are you doing?
Do n't do this.
Moon, do n't do this.
You... Was the hole too shallow?
Congratulations, anyway. You survived.
There's a present for you in the bag.
Do n't play games with another man's life.
Ha- ha. You asshole.
You're trying to be cool to the end, huh?
Do as I say, asshole.
He says you have 15 minutes.
Call him as soon as you figure out what you should say.
Remember what happened with Young - duk back then?
"No turning back. Just accept it."
And you just cut his wrist.
Spend your 15 minutes wisely. Do n't disappoint the boss.
They're probably digging the hole three times deeper this time.
Yes, I see.
Did you beg for forgiveness?
So this is how it ends.
They're worse than we are.
Seems you have a lot of guests.
He wants to run again...
Anyway, I heard the news.
You should have just left it to us from the beginning.
I'm sorry. I was rude.
No, it's mostly my fault.
If the hammer is light, the nail will rise back up.
Years ago, a smart young man was working for me.
One day I got him to do a simple job.
Thinking about it now, it was n't such a serious mistake.
But he was kind of strange.
He said he did n't do anything wrong.
He could've been right. It might have been my fault.
But what are families for?
If the boss says you're wrong, then you're wrong even if you did n't really do it.
But that guy lost his hand.
One promising guy's life ended just like that one morning.
This time, one hand is not enough.
Yes, I see.
Do I look all right?
He used to have a good reputation, did n't he?
Reasons do n't matter anymore.
I guess I'm going to put an end to this anyway.
Will this be okay? Check if this is shady money.
Let me see what kind of guy this is.
What are you going to use it for?
Do I have to tell you all that?
No matter how much money you pay.
What shall we do?
I ca n't figure out this guy.
What if he's a rat for the cops?
Are you sure he's not a rat?
Do n't yell in my ear.
Tell him to come tomorrow by 4.
Mikhail, if it were you, would you come again?
We said we would n't use names. You moron!
How would you like it if I said your name is Myung - gu?
How would you like it, asshole?
Yes, asshole, I said you're an asshole!
Are you going to screw with me?
Go back to your country!
Is there anyone who can vouch for you?
We ca n't give you anything unless we're sure about you.
Find someone by tomorrow who can vouch for you.
All right, see you tomorrow.
Hey, watch it!
I do n't recognize this number.
Who did you say referred you?
President Han introduced me.
He says it's President Han from Gyungsan.
What's your connection with him?
He supplies our place with Russian dancers.
I see. But why do you need our merchandise?
I'm just following orders, so I do n't know the specifics.
Have you used this sort of Merchandise before?
I used to be a bodyguard.
Hey, bring the guns over here.
Have you ever seen anything like this?
You brought the money?
I told you already.
I heard what you said, but...
I'd like to hear what Han Sang - shik has to say.
Hey, give Mr. Han a call...
It will only take a second.
Want me to teach you how to use it while we wait?
All right, now watch me and do what I do.
You have to be able to do this to teach others how to use them.
Now, first... unscrew this... then push this up and in.
And then... bang.
Try one more time.
Okay, let's see how well you were watching.
Alright, alright, one second.
Let's start at the same time, okay?
One, two, three.
You know, the errand guy.
Why are n't you answering?
I'm bringing the merchandise. I'll be there in about an hour.
Stop staring at me and call President Baek.
I do n't have much time.
I've been waiting here forever. Call me right away when you get this message.
Thought you'd never see me again?
Hey, let's be professional.
I thought about it, and lots of people have bad memories, right?
Memories that can never be erased, no matter what.
I mean, the people who caused those memories.
What are you talking about?
And I'm... oh, never mind.
Let me ask you one thing. Why did you do that to me?
You thought I was an amateur?
You think it's unfair? Unfair?
You keep looking in all the wrong places.
Then you should n't have come to me.
Life is about suffering.
Did n't you know that?
Hey you, stand up straight. Straight.
I'll teach you a lesson. Stand up straight.
Oh, hi, how are you?
Did you hear some kind of bang?
The sound of a hole being ripped out of life.
I wonder what the politicians are doing for us.
Because of the new bus - only lanes, Driving downtown is harder.
You messed with the wrong guy. Watch yourself.
Bring me a phone.
Bring me a phone, you asshole!
You've seen Sunwoo, right?
You mean Mr. Kim?
That's right, Manager Kim.
You have n't seen him lately, have you?
How would I know?
Hey Mi-ae. I'm on my way now.
How did it get to this point?
Let's not make a fuss.
This is my last stop.
I've nowhere to go.
You really want to take it this far?
Why did you do that to me?
No, not that kind of thing. Tell me the real reason.
I've been thinking about this a lot, and I still do n't get it.
Tell me, how did we come to this?
How did this happen?
Were you really going to kill me?
I've served you like a dog, for 7 years. Say me something.
What's gotten into you?
Was it because of her?
But we ca n't turn back time now, can we?
This is too harsh... One late autumn night, the disciple woke up crying.
- "Did you have a nightmare?" - "No."
"Did you have a sad dream?"
"No," said the disciple.
"I had a sweet dream."
Then why are you crying so sadly?
"Because the dream I had ca n't come true."
U. S. military escort CDC team requesting permission to enter Egyptian airspace.
Dr. Scott, off to the right, take a look.
He's on approach.
Time to target, three minutes.
Two - two - zero.
Dr. Scott, prepare for landing.
Putting down close to the LP.
Doctor, you've got five minutes.
There are 6000 quarantined in this camp.
We have 387 dead.
My staff is down to six.
I thought you were bringing more doctors.
These are the latest to come down with the virus.
Once the spots come, they die in two days.
Chief Spurling, Chief Lewis, we are getting underway at 1300.
Let's pick up the pace.
Yeah, I know all about the Naval Mountain Warfare Unit but never heard of a dog setting foot on a destroyer.
This is Admiral Halsey.
- And he's a mean operator.
Well, so is the captain.
You can just put that down over there.
That's delicate equipment.
I take it you're my new houseguest.
Sorry we had to take over your helicopter bay but it was the only space large enough to accommodate our lab.
I got 217 men and women on this ship.
Anything I should be concerned about?
What exactly are you gonna be studying up there?
We are virologists tracking obscure microbes in hard - to - get - to places.
Pretty boring stuff, actually.
We really do appreciate your assistance, Captain Chandler.
Welcome aboard, doctor.
Bird's chocked and chained. Heading to the barn.
Damn, it's cold.
I ca n't feel my face.
Granderson, tell me, do I still have a face? Yes, sir.
Though it looks like you could use some lip balm, sir.
I should have taken that desk job in Miami.
XO Slattery, let's see if we can get your frozen ass back to Norfolk.
- Bridge, TAO.
Helo just dropped the target for our final missile test.
Target's 5 feet long, 2 feet wide, and in the icy water has no heat signature.
Let's find it and kill it.
- Kill track 5205.
- Kill track 0845, aye.
MSS, kill track 0845.
Two - two - zero - 30.
- Target confirmed, kill.
Good afternoon, Nathan James.
After four very challenging months at the top of the world we have just passed our final test and I'm proud to say you did it with flying colors.
I'm asking the Pentagon if we can break radio silence today to make calls and e-mail.
Bravo Zulu to each and every one of you.
Enjoy your success, because we're going home.
Gonna drop to 50 below.
Get them off the ice.
Dr. Scott, come in.
Dr. Scott, are you there?
You have got to be kidding me.
We need to make sure the isolate is n't contaminated.
- We need more samples.
- It's all right.
We can come back tomorrow.
Ma'am, we've been trying to reach you.
CO wants you back on the ship.
You can tell the captain that I'll return when I'm ready.
It was n't an invitation, ma'am.
Gear down and locked.
Twenty feet, 10 feet, wheels down.
You do n't think the Cubs are in it?
- We were six games up when we left.
- That was June.
And they're the Cubs.
Captain Chandler, you had no right to pull me from my work.
Those men are here to support me.
You do n't send them to bring me in.
- Those men are sailors in the U.S. Navy.
- I say when I am done and ready.
First of all, thanks for checking in. Think this is the first time you've said more than three words to me since we left Norfolk.
I am sorry that I have n't had you over for tea.
You know, your attitude was mildly charming back in June, in Virginia but up here at 50 below, when none of us have talked to our families in four months?
Now, I think I've been more than a gracious host. Taxied you and your assistant around here so you can chase after your ducks.
- Need to wrap it up.
Our mission's done, and we'll be heading back.
I'll take a rain check on the tea.
- Benzo, eat some fruit.
Mr. Chung, it's our last night at the North Pole.
You got big plans, but do n't you ever get your head out of that book?
- You know what that smile does to me.
- We'll be home soon enough.
Hello, are you reading me?
No, I can not wait.
This is Dr. Rachel Scott.
I need to speak to the national security advisor right away.
My mission is being compromised.
I need more time to collect samples.
We have a noisy channel.
We are ready to come home.
That's a negative, commander.
- The mission has been extended.
Maintain radio silence and current position until you receive further instructions.
What the hell is that woman doing?
I think we've got it.
Did I wake you?
Doc told me to keep my distance.
The admiral's scaring off the birds.
Man, we should've been out of here days ago.
- Make that five unknown aircraft approaching, range 24 nautical miles, 80 knots.
- We have to save the samples.
- Leave the box.
Rachel, leave the box.
Man your battle stations.
Transit up and forward starboard side, down portside.
New air contact 80234 at 015 at 36,000 yards.
TAO surface manned and ready.
- Hard left rudder.
All engines ahead flank.
United States Naval warship.
Identify yourself and alter course or you will be subject to defensive actions.
- All hands, brace for shock.
Go to the 5 inch.
- Surface TAO, kill track 5024.
Guns. Kill track 5024.
- She's banged up.
Doc's looking at her in Hangar 2.
Are we at war?
Get me Fleet Forces.
If they do n't answer, get me SECDEF.
- Supposed to be radio silent.
I told you I'm fine.
I need my samples.
You do n't get your samples until you tell me what's going on here.
You have no authority over me.
You need to hand that case to me.
We may have just gone to war with Russia, and they were after you.
Tell me about the cure.
I swear to God, I will throw this overboard!
Seven months ago, outside Cairo, there was an outbreak. A virus of unknown origin.
Its genetic structure was like nothing any of us had ever seen.
It swept throughout the village, killing everyone that it infected.
Egyptian officials claim the outbreak was contained, but it was n't.
Instead, it continued to mutate and spread.
The CDC and the WHO wanted to sample the virus and the victims to create a vaccine.
It was my belief that we needed to find the primordial strain here in the Arctic.
They're just the carriers.
They pick up the virus from the melting permafrost.
We finally found their feeding ground.
- You have what you need to stop this thing?
- I wo n't know until we get it to the lab.
The virus is moving quicker than any of us could have imagined.
We've been radio silent since Norfolk.
Because I have my own satphone.
We were at EMCON so no one would know our position.
Well, you led the Russians right to us and endangered my entire crew.
It was imperative I stay in contact with the labs back home to keep them informed of my progress.
I do n't think you understand what we're talking about here.
- When we left Norfolk the virus was at phase two limited to small clusters in Asia and Africa.
We are now at phase six global pandemic.
Eighty percent of the world's population is infected.
The world is sick, Captain Chandler.
Are you telling me the whole world is dying, and they sent two people to save it?
It took weeks to convince the government to even send me here.
- Most of my colleagues think that I'm insane.
I told you that what's in that case might be the only hope that we have.
Captain? We have the president of the United States on the vidcom.
I'm sorry you had to find out this way.
Can I have my samples now?
- Good morning, commander.
I know, the last you heard I was Speaker of the House.
The president died two months ago. The vice president a week later.
What's left of the federal government is holed up 200 feet below the White House and communication is getting spotty.
Does Dr. Scott have what she needs to make a vaccine?
She thinks so, ma'am.
Ma'am, we were just attacked by the Russians.
Russia no longer has a functioning government.
From what we're hearing, a breakaway force is operating on its own authority.
I wish I could tell you, captain.
Most of our population, including our Armed Forces, is dying or dead.
We have no enemies.
Just a world of sick, desperate people.
Your ship was fortunate enough to be out of the hot zone these past months.
If Dr. Scott has the makings of a cure, you have to come home now.
Supply chains are completely broken.
With possibly half the world's population dead or dying rumors that the U.S. is hoarding a vaccine continue to swirl.
Urban services are overwhelmed.
The people are asking, "Where is the government?"
The virus has no treatment, no vaccine.
- So this whole weapons test --
And EMCON Alpha, keep us in the dark about what was going on at home.
There's an unmanned refueling station off the coast of France.
If we operate at trail shaft, we should just make it.
How do we know they have fuel to get us across the Atlantic?
- What will we tell the crew?
We tell them everything.
Ship's company, attention.
I have news from home.
Any station this net, this is Nathan James transmitting in the blind on FLEETSAT one, two and three. Over.
I ca n't believe I'm gonna go that long without hearing your voice.
Sir, we're 50 miles off the coast of Europe and still no contact with French Naval Command.
We've got extra watch and guns at the ready.
Were you able to reach home?
I think only four people got through to anyone and the news was n't good.
Last time we made port in France I promised my girlfriend we'd come back and see Paris together.
I got through to home.
My boy's gone.
Christine is up in Deer Park, some sort of safe zone, for now.
- Why do n't you take a break?
I'm not gonna sit around my cabin staring at the walls.
We have a fire order.
﻿It came across all channels, but it's garbled.
Missile incoming high and fast.
Coordinates do n't make sense.
- ECO, aye.
MM1, align four echo missiles and place in the reload pool.
- Do we have a target ID?
- Now, five - one and trail.
Missile fired from a surface ship in the North Atlantic.
Ballistic missile traveling at 9700 miles per hour.
Confirmed, we have a nuclear bird in the air.
- We have no chance to intercept.
Officer at the one, seal the ship.
Prepare for nuclear detonation.
Sir, the missile overshot us.
Detonation in 12 seconds.
I need a status report on the switchboard and generators.
- Chung, sir.
What's our engine status?
Sir, the electromagnetic pulse from the bomb blew our grid.
Emergency lights on battery power.
COMMO says the radios are down.
Move this ship away from the blast zone.
- What temperature are we at?
- 41 degrees. We've lost negative pressure.
- Okay, get the ice.
Open valves three, four and five.
Shut valve to auxiliary engines and emergency air.
- All right, give it a kick start.
Sir, we only have one more fuse.
Jet stream's pushing everything north - northeast.
- Sir, it wo n't hold.
- It'll hold.
- Captain, let somebody else do this.
- Captain, do n't.
- I said, rip it!
Bad - ass, captain.
All engines ahead full.
Steady on new course 270.
- What's our fuel percentage?
- Eleven percent, sir.
Even at max conserve, we'll run dry in six hours.
- Any contacts on surface search?
- No, sir, 30 - mile range.
- What is that in the radar shadow?
- Change range scale.
Looks like a ship.
Markings indicate the ship is Italian.
- Bridge to Bridge operational?
- I think so, sir.
Vessel in vicinity 48 degrees north, 15 degrees west this is U.S. Navy Warship 151 on your starboard bow.
Acknowledge and identify yourself.
Smith, Rowler, Benz, Green, you're on provisions.
Master chief, you'll assist Chung with the unrep.
Remember, if the ship has been impacted by the virus, it's airborne and highly, highly contagious. Even from a recently deceased corpse.
You must keep your helmets on at all times.
We got the stock rooms.
Benzo and I will make our way to the galley.
- Get that fuel line across and pump it.
No one alive, Commander Chandler.
The only thing that can help him is morphine.
Master chief, we're running dry here.
- Engineering, Bridge.
- They've got it, Chung.
- You're gonna be fine.
- I am not leaving you, Frankie.
- I'm a dead man.
I'm not leaving you.
He's been exposed.
We put him back in his suit and we quarantine him on the ship.
You ca n't risk it, sir.
I'm not too interested in dying like these people.
Give me the gun, sailor.
Frankie, do n't be stupid.
I am giving you a direct order!
Lord God, by the power of your word you stilled the chaos of the primeval seas made the raging waters of the flood subside and calmed the storm on the Sea of Galilee.
As we commit our brother, Franklin Edward Benz, to the sea grant him peace and tranquility until that day when Franklin and all those who believe in you will be raised to the glory of new life promised in the waters of baptism.
These people depend on me.
You saw this coming.
I never thought it would spread so fast.
But now I know why it did.
I compared the blood that we took from the Italian to some samples I took before we left.
The virus has an extra gene now which could have only been added with human intervention.
Maybe, or maybe it escaped from a lab somehow.
But I think I know how to stop it.
All the virus cares about is replicating.
So it no longer needs to mutate which makes it stable and easier to defeat with a vaccine.
Then why has n't anybody done that yet?
Because they did n't have the primordial sample.
Bridge, COMMO. Get me the captain.
Sir, we finally got the comms up.
We need to confirm these.
Get me the Pentagon.
- Sir, I've been trying, but there's no answer.
- I'll try the lab.
President wants us to change course.
There's a lab in Jacksonville that's secure.
Signal's not getting out.
Checked the transmit side?
That's not the problem.
Their phones are ringing.
Sir, I have another message coming through.
It was transmitted at the same time as POTUS '.
It looks like a much bigger file.
- It's an mpeg, sir.
We managed to get out early and have been up here for a couple months already.
But, honey, we're fine.
Daddy, where are you?
We love you, Daddy.
Just get here if you can.
I do n't know what we're going home to.
No radiation detected within a hundred - mile radius, sir.
You said you have what it takes to make the vaccine.
If you had to, could you do it here on the ship?
The lab was n't built for that.
- It's for collecting data.
- But if you had to, could you?
The expeditionary team will forward deploy and secure the area for the next group.
Hopefully, we'll find support.
Got ta be prepared for anything.
Everyone carries their own biohazard suit.
We do not engage unless we are engaged.
Prepare your people, await further orders.
Still no answer from POTUS and nothing from Mayport or the lab.
We ca n't even get an FM radio signal.
If the power grid's down, everything's down.
We'll know more when we get boots on the ground.
Mike, we're not going home.
The lab's 200 miles inland.
You saw the news footage.
- Too many variables.
- What do we do, we stay on the ship?
Dr. Scott says she has what she needs here.
We have orders from the president of the United States.
From five days ago.
In the absence of command structure I decide what's in the best interest of our mission.
- We'll find what we need.
- We'll die out there.
- No, we will not.
Tom, I appreciate what you're trying to do.
It's not gonna work.
People wanna get home.
And who exactly gets to go home when we have 80 biohazard suits for 216 people?
- I ca n't think like that, Mike.
Give people a chance to get back to their families, to say goodbye.
I'm not letting anybody on this ship give up.
- It's not your call.
You do n't get to play God.
- I'm still the captain of this ship.
Now, I've laid out our mission.
I expect you to fall in line.
All engines ahead flank, aye.
The country we all hoped we were coming back to no longer exists.
On board this ship is the hope for our futures, for our families, and for all humanity.
Our mission now is simple.
We do whatever it takes to stay alive at sea until they find that cure.
For the moment, that is our destination.
I'll be waiting for you.
After you change, no one else will understand.
He'll put her on the index, tag her like a shark.
- What's doing this?
I ca n't control it when I get upset.
You will control your emotions, just like we practiced.
Everyone is at risk.
You and Bobbi... what's up?
I know Coulson does n't know about it, but I bet he'd like to. 2x13 - "One of Us"
... then at last, to be told there's no hope.
- I'm not to see.
You're going to see with my eyes.
That's why I'm here.
Listen, you called me "friend" once.
Will you let me be hands and eyes to you?
Is this Karla Faye Gideon?
Got your name off the gifted index.
I'll try not to be offended.
Levi... an old buddy of mine.
Could n't get within 100 feet of any tech.
I found him holed up in an RV in the Mojave.
But now, Sans chip, this guy manages to decrypt the index for me.
Led me to Francis.
How long has it been since you touched someone, since you felt a sensation on your fingertips?
We want to free you from these shackles.
All you got to do is say that you...
Feels good, does n't it?
We're gonna teach them a lesson, and we want you to join us.
I sound bat - guano crazy.
Director is a door - to - door salesman of a man.
- Still, I'm... I'm not powerful myself.
I got to say, Director, no doubt, the best grilled cheese I've ever had.
Do n't ask. I will not disclose.
- How you doing with all the monitoring?
- I barely notice it.
We would n't subject you to it if it was n't absolutely necessary.
I assume you're putting me on the gifted index.
My entire life, I've been searching for my parents, and my search ended with answers that are so much worse than I could have imagined.
Trip was not your fault.
My point is, I'm steady.
I'm stopping them before they start.
- If I keep working on this,
She's acting like everything will go back to normal.
Does she know we're putting her on the index?
She does seem to be getting control of the powers.
That's good, but we barely understand them...
- other than they're strong.
Protocol is anyone on the index undergoes a full psych eval and threat assessment.
We'd need to bring in someone from outside.
Someone we can trust.
if it were n't a thing.
It's not a thing.
He might say no.
Wonder where she's off to.
- I do n't have answers to.
Coulson asked me to complete Skye's index file to the best of my ability.
I'm afraid my best is woefully insufficient.
- It's bizarre, the extra macromolecules.
- Raina's DNA is the same.
I'm just, um, looking for...
That I do n't understand at all.
- How long are you gonna give him?
- He lied to me.
Fitz's intentions were good.
He wanted to protect a friend.
And how is that protecting her?
Corrupting data, altering test results?
Fitz and I shared science.
Now that's changed, too.
I have to accept that he's different now and our relationship wo n't ever be what it was.
Little early to sound the funeral bells, do n't you think?
A betrayal of trust like that, it changes everything.
I just made it to the nearest safe house.
- This is such a mess.
- Yeah, a mess I did n't make, but I'm cleaning it up the best way I can.
I was n't gonna let him expose us.
- All right, so what now, Bobbi?
Mack, are you talking to Bobbi?
Tell her I take it all back.
- All the "do n't die out there..."
I'd be better off if she had died out...
- I never wanted this.
- No one did.
but I got no exit strategy, and the longer I'm gone, the more questions Coulson's gonna have.
We'll bring him in.
I'll arrange an extraction.
- And you know where I'll be.
Well, there's no substitute for actually spending time with a patient.
You just ca n't get around it.
What about the new software to track emotional health?
Software wo n't anticipate a manson or a Bin Laden.
The human mind is infinitely complicated.
It's messy and and surprising.
I moved on for a reason.
It's a different S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson's the director now.
She's that good.
- You're back in the field?
- What do I think?
What the hell, Melinda?
You show up asking for a favor, but when I called you after S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed to check if you were all right, - not a word.
- It was a busy time.
"Busy." Yeah, all right.
Well... thanks for the apology.
No observation, no monitoring, other than what's deemed medically necessary.
My evaluation wo n't be. She gets a copy.
My consultation fee's gone up.
I should have called you back.
- Nah, I talked to your mom.
She told me you were alive.
We had a nice talk.
- I'm not surprised.
She still has n't forgiven me for divorcing you.
Francis, would you be so kind as to let us in?
Dr. Garner, good to see you again.
- I appreciate you coming back to help.
- Congrats on the promotion.
Or should I offer my condolences?
Just been informed of a break - in at Brynmore psychiatric facility.
Houses criminally insane types.
Except for the secret sub - basement under the North wing.
Mentally unstable people on the index are housed there.
- Is that who they're after?
- That's what we're going to find out.
I'll prep the Quinjet.
Agent Morse, Hunter did n't report in today.
"Permanent" is n't really Hunter's thing.
- Did n't think he scared so easily.
I'll meet you down there.
I'm so glad you're here, especially since it's been well documented that powers can lead to psychological volatility.
Not that Skye's showing any signs.
Her vitals currently are steady.
I did not know that you were married.
So, it might be wise to do a pharmacological evaluation.
Should probably meet her before writing a prescription.
- I'll take you to her.
- I appreciate the extensive - and thorough debrief, Agent Simmons.
Let me talk to her first.
Skye might have a... reaction.
You're kidding, right?
- It's not personal.
- Hell, it's not personal.
It's standard procedure for anyo...
No, I know, but I'm not just on the index.
I'm also an agent.
So you know it's non-negotiable.
Andrew is good, and he's done this before.
So have I. I grew up in the system.
I've been through enough of these to know that I hate them.
- You'll like this one.
- Yeah, how do you know that?
Because I was married to him.
Tell me about the wedding.
I'm thinking May could go either way... understated or full bridezilla.
She can be a control freak.
- I'm not here to discuss my ex.
- Did you guys have actual conversations?
You know, like, pillow talk, or was it just pillow stern looks?
How long are you going to deflect?
Barely in, and out comes the psychobabble.
It's not psychobabble.
It's just a word that describes what you're doing.
Well, I read your history.
I know this is n't your first rodeo.
Speaking of... the Cavalry...
something you both have in common.
- Why did you shoot yourself?
I mean, it was an icer.
I'm not suicidal.
No, I did n't say you were, but it's an aggressive move.
I did what I had to do to protect my team.
You're an agent.
And I imagine you must be afraid that you're gonna lose that.
We did n't want a big wedding.
And, no, it was n't Vegas.
Although Melinda does love Vegas.
I also shot myself because I...
I could n't stop what I was doing.
Thank you, Agent Broyles.
So, when the communications and electrical systems were fried, a group used the chaos to tear through the facility, opening doors, releasing prisoners.
Yeah, whoever did this did some serious damage to the system.
I'm recovering what was recorded before the power went out.
- Is that Skye's dad?
- Who's he waving to?
You should n't have come down here.
Now, where's bachelor number two?
David A. Angar... vocal cords exposed to experimental energy blasts.
Shrunk the tumors, but left him with a voice that triggers the central nervous system, induces immediate catatonia with the slightest whisper.
Here's his room.
Other than Skye's father being crazy?
They'll come to us.
- I told her we eloped.
A little gossip won you some points.
Hmm, I appreciate you giving me permission - to disclose details when necessary.
She thinks the world of you.
Of course she likes me.
All work and no play.
- When I multitask, I make mistakes.
Sounds like there's a story there.
I saw a frame on your desk.
- Are n't you a little too old for that?
- Well... You tell me about your mistake, and I'll tell you about it.
I do n't care that much.
I can fix you something.
I'm not that hungry.
Wo n't stay long. Just need to use the microwave.
I did n't want to disturb May and her ex.
- In the kitchen, talking.
What are they talking about?
Is it about, um, Skye's condition?
May is n't a good cook.
Something Agent May does n't excel at.
- And she was laughing.
- Oh, he makes her laugh.
Clearly, she still likes him, and have you seen the way he looks at her?
Yeah, I have eyes, Jemma.
Of course I've seen.
I wonder what happened between them, why it ended.
Yeah, they're a bizarre pair.
He listens for a living, and she does n't speak.
True, but you know what they say about opposites.
Get may and Dr. Garner now!
Skye, you need to wake up.
You're doing this.
You're shaking the room.
You need to stop.
- If she needs a sedative...
- I'm gonna stay.
If the RV passes a traffic cam or toll booth, we'll find them.
At least we know who we're looking for.
Uh, well, sometimes ignorance is bless.
Wendell Levi... genius - level IQ, but no moral compass or regard for human life.
Noche was a mob enforcer who wanted to be better at enforcing, so he got his hands on some experimental steroids.
Left him incredibly strong.
Sir, these people are on the index, but they're not exactly gifted.
They were considered highly dangerous.
A larger part of the index functions as more of a watch list.
Karla Faye Gideon... razors permanently grafted into her fingers?
- It's like a lifetime movie.
And I'd feel bad for her except her boyfriend was n't her only victim.
You're sure Skye's father's the ringleader?
"Fight on."
Could be a call to arms.
Maybe he wants to wage war on us, but where?
- You ought to try the sausage biscuits.
- I do n't like food.
- You're an interesting fellow.
- Maybe it would make more sense just to forget about S.H.I.E.L.D.... M - Move on.
I mean, have n't they robbed us of enough?
We ca n't just slink away and let them take from us.
They stole her from me, and they still have her.
She is n't safe there.
Losing a child, it... it tears you apart!
I'm just like you.
I could n't protect the people I loved.
So I tried to change, improve myself, with chemistry.
But I keep working on a formula.
We ca n't stop now.
We ca n't let them make us afraid or make the world afraid of us!
They are the criminals, and we're gonna shine a light on that!
The reason Hunter left was n't the job offer, was it?
You're a hard person to read, but Hunter is n't.
How long have you two been sleeping together?
I should have reported the change in our relationship, but is this the right time to discuss this?
If we were making any headway, I'd say no, but we're stuck.
And when I'm stuck, it helps to do something else... listen to music, twirl a baton, talk about something else.
They say your subconscious keeps working the problem.
I broke it off.
Hunter slipped back into his old patterns, which involves bailing and beer.
Mack's gone to find him, and history repeats itself.
Oh, my god. "Fight on."
We got a hit on the license plate.
- Why Manitowoc, Wisconsin?
- I was born there.
- He's trying to lure me home.
- How are you doing that?
You focus on a single point, let everything else become noise disappearing in the background.
Except it does n't disappear.
You're pushing it aside.
Which is why, when you were dreaming, The tremors started.
- What were you dreaming about?
- You're seeming defensive.
- Because you keep pressing.
Because whatever you were feeling was strong enough to shake this entire plane.
How about you show me an inkblot, and I'll tell you about my first time?
So that's your thing.
Well, that's an effective way to avoid thinking about how monumentally painful your life is right now.
- What am I avoiding, exactly?
That you're different now, that you have abilities, abilities triggered by pain, and either you face that or you do n't sleep again.
I dreamed I was on mission, looking through the scope on my rifle.
The next thing I knew, I was on the other side.
The rifle was trained on me.
Yeah, to being on the index.
I have executed that policy.
Skye, I need you to stop.
Which is why I need you to breathe.
I'm not doing this.
Look, I was gonna come talk to you once I put the bus on auto.
When we're already in the air?
Plus, you were in session.
I did n't want to interrupt.
Let me.
I think I might cry.
I thought the prisoner got to choose his last meal.
If you were supposed to be dead, you'd already be dead.
Hey, look, man, I'm just doing what has to be done.
Do you remember when we first met?
I was working back end for Bobbi on that mission in Dubai, and you and I were stuck on a construction site
What the hell are you and Bobbi into, Mack?
You'll know soon enough.
If you've got nothing to say, why do n't you just leave?
I'll tell you what I remember, Mack.
Dubai was a cover.
And because I was n't S.H.I.E.L.D., you did n't tell me.
Lies... that's what I remember.
That not - talking thing you do... not okay when we were married, but definitely not okay now.
Not okay is Skye's lunatic father leading Coulson into a trap.
- And me and Skye, we do what?
- Same as if we were on base.
Stay in the cage. Continue your evaluation.
That's so not gonna happen.
This is not a negotiation, Skye.
You're staying on the bus.
- If Coulson needs backup...
- He'll have it.
We do n't need you.
My father's involved.
And for better or worse, I matter to him,
- And we can use that.
- I'm with May.
This is an emotional powder keg
- you should n't be anywhere near.
- We ca n't risk you losing control.
- You do n't know that.
- Yes, I do.
I know, because those windows are n't shattered in a million pieces right now, because this plane is n't coming apart.
I'm feeling all of it.
I'm locking it down just like you trained me to do.
Having contact with your father is a bad idea.
- I'll ice myself.
Look. You put me on the index.
You're doing my intake assessment.
How about we let my dad know?
- Is this your high school?
- I never went here.
My dad coached football and taught history.
- I was 9 when he died.
I've forgotten more about him than I remember.
I want to welcome you to this historic matchup between the S.H.I.E.L.D. Eagles and us, rivals and underdogs, the...
Leading off for S.H.I.E.L.D., an ugly piece of work and your native son.
Five of them, two of us...
Here's a fun fact.
He killed the man I had been plotting to kill for 2 1 / 2 decades!
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
You're seeming rude, Phil.
We went to all this trouble.
You see, we got these kids here, these kids with their whole lives in front of them.
Are n't you gonna help?
Or have I misjudged you, Phil?
Are you gonna stand by while we hurt them?
No one else needs to get hurt.
- Let them go.
- They ca n't go anywhere.
we took their potential and contained it, - inhibited it like you do.
- To criminals, not cheerleaders.
Would you please check him?
We want everyone to know what you do to people like us.
And we want you to stop before you do it to her.
- Talking about her?
- What have they done to you?
contain her or put her down.
- Tell me they did n't hurt you.
- Talk to me, not her.
Now, you let these people go, or your daughter dies.
I ca n't lose you again.
Do n't you see what they do?
And it scares the hell out of them.
I think it's wonderful.
So, tell me, what's your thing?
- I mean, I was hoping it was wings.
You threatened to kill me, your own father.
You did n't know any better.
You wo n't kill her.
Though, the truth is, you're capable of such things.
That's what I'm trying to teach this whole damn town.
I do n't even know if they're listening.
Maybe they'll listen to you.
I already tried that.
Daisy, what have they done to you?
You're probably feeling a little drowsy.
We gave you something to help you sleep.
- Why do I have these bruises?
- I ran some tests.
The bruising was caused by capillary ruptures in your arms.
X - rays showed more than 75 hairline fractures - from your clavicle to your fingers.
You were n't stopping your powers, Skye.
You were... directing them inward.
What am I supposed to do?
I made the casts from compression microfibers to help contain the shaking, minimize the damage.
That's not what she means, Simmons.
We'll figure this out, Skye.
"Gifted" is both insufficient and too broad.
I believe there are two categories we're dealing with.
Um, "enhanced" is what I would suggest we call people like David Angar, Mike Peterson... people whose gifts were man-made.
We need to understand more about their powers, especially how to stop them in case that becomes necessary.
This is a priority, Agent Simmons.
- And, Agent Simmons... keep this between us.
Do n't bring anyone else in.
I left Coulson and Skye copies of my report.
I assume you're recommending Skye be removed from active duty.
It's too much for her to deal with... emotionally, physically.
She needs to be somewhere safe to do that.
She is safe... with us.
You really believe that?
You better than anyone knows how badly this can end.
- We're as close to a family as Skye has.
Would you consider consulting for us?
I can suggest someone, but it ca n't be me.
None of it's changed.
There was a reason I moved on back then.
And I have another reason now.
Her photo's on my desk.
But now Bobbi and I work for an organization, an outlier that came out of the wreckage from what Fury left.
What organization, Mack?
Who the hell are you working for?
Why did n't you take Daisy?
She needs to be away from those animals that have her.
- What we do is none of your concern.
- Then why am I here?
- Because you're making too much noise.
I'm sounding a battle cry!
There is no "us." You're not one of us.
You're a science experiment.
So what happens to me, then?
I've been sober for a year.
That does n't erase the things that I did,
"dear jim, I thought I could be
"strong and brave for you,
"but I ca n't.
"I'm going away for a while To get myself together."
Trust me, and I'll trust you.
In the meantime, Each of your tariffs will increase 25%.
Reach out to saviano and turski.
They are worried about ending up like bannion.
The old man is herding his sheep toward me.
Security guard for nut jobs?
It's that or quit.
That's what they want me to do.
I'm not gonna stop, harvey.
I'm gonna get'em.
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
I'll rack thee with old cramps.
Tremble at thy din.
"it will control my dam's god."
My dam's god setebos
And make a vassal of him.
This is the fourth inmate outburst in as many weeks
As you've been stationed here.
Punishment duty for you,
This is unacceptable, gordon.
It's my fault, mr. Lang.
The play was too upsetting.
We'll stick to comedies from now on, I think.
Thank you, nurse duncan.
It's "director" or "dr. Lang,"
Recreational activities Are not pertinent to this conversation.
For security on this wing,
A task which he seems unable to manage.
What have you to say about this, gordon?
This man needs medical attention.
I'd see to him myself, But there's rules.
I dispense meds, not treatment.
He needs a doctor.
I'll send one in.
And I'll have you placed on the remedial duty roster.
Think you ca n't fall any farther?
Detective jim gordon, are n't you?
I'm not sure about "famous."
I'm not an inmate.
I have n't seen you on infirmary duty before.
I work in the female ward.
All the girls are talking about you.
Brave detective brought low By fighting city hall.
They say that, do they?
I'm sorry, I did n't mean to make light of your situation.
Personally, I think what you're doing is admirable.
I'm guarding lunatics.
It's none of my business.
Thompkins, You sure this inmate's gonna be okay?
He's just sleeping off his meds.
Get a room, you guys.
It's nice to meet you, jim.
I... I'm good.
Like you need a doctor.
Never, ever again.
I - I'm fine.
I got a place we can go, ivy.
We'll only stay until you feel better.
What if the real people come home?
There's dust on everything
Whose place is this, anyways?
How come you ask so many questions, ivy?
I'm trying to help you.
Now lie down and I'll get you a blanket.
Have you considered my proposition?
We already pay enough.
Don maroni set the rates last year.
You're beginning to irk me.
You're talking to me, the penguin.
So you're penguin.
I called the cops on you.
And that was a very naive call to make.
Hello, we own the cops on the waterfront.
Tell that to the cops, buddy.
And electricity was applied to his frontal lobes.
Surgically, it's used to modify aberrant behavior,
But in this case, way too much voltage was used And his brain is completely fried.
How did this happen?
That's that nature of municipal operations.
You inherit problems And you use the resources at hand to do with you can.
Well, our resources do n't stretch nearly far enough To cover a criminal assault investigation.
We should call the gcpd.
No, this is an in - house medical issue.
Well, yes, but he's effectively brain dead.
He's still breathing.
For all official purposes, well, He's still alive.
Keep him comfortable, doctor.
I want a report on my desk Friday.
Another day, another dollar.
This is rather usual And sinister, is n't it?
So, who are we looking for?
What does it take to pull this off?
Some basic knowledge of human anatomy.
Um, basic electrical skills.
A circuit board, Some wiring.
And the door keys, of course.
"the door keys."
No, man, I got my keys right here.
Look at me, steven.
Tell me the truth.
Why you picking on me?
There's five other guards with keys to this wing.
True, and you're the only one who looks And smells like a hunted animal.
Now, we've searched all the inmates' cells.
But I know they're out there.
And I need to know where.
I'm backed up against the wall here.
And I'm starting to lose my patience -- do you understand?
That fight... During the play.
Right after, I noticed my keys were gone.
You lose equipment, that's a big deal.
They dock me a week's pay, so I tracked done a spare set!
Who took the keys?
Anyone could've taken them.
Killed bannion like he was nobody.
I wish something would happen to old man falcone Before he comes after one of us.
That's where this is going.
Now, let's imagine God forbid anything happened to falcone.
Who would take over then?
Now, that never occurred to me.
I'm next in line.
It's a new dawn, a new city.
I would believe we would need Some fresh thinking at the top.
And who is the fresh thinker that you got in mind?
She's talking about her.
You do n't think I could run the family?
Hey, no, why not?
Woman's lib and all that.
But fair play, jimmy is next in line.
Well, there's no need to argue.
It's all hypotheticals anyhow.
We're just talking, right?
Inmate 5075 jack gruber.
Did you take officer wenger's keys?
You're looking into the sad demise of the frogman.
The frogman disrupted your play last night.
You did n't like him very much, did you?
Well, I had no opinion of him.
He was called the frogman because he believed A giant bullfrog lived inside his abdomen, Controlling his thoughts.
He was already dead.
I do n't waste psychic energy on the dead.
You're no stranger to violence, gruber.
Your psych evals say you're a grade - a sociopath.
Why should I take your word for anything?
You should n't believe everything you read, jim.
May I call you jim?
Search my cell if you do not find me trustworthy,
But, no, jim, I did not take anyone's keys.
Did you take officer wenger's keys?
Did you take the guard's keys?
Am I in trouble?
Unless you're lying to me.
He does n't have the concept, Poor peaceful soul that he is.
He killed his family with an axe.
Is n't that what you did, aaron?
You saw how that went.
Saviano's the problem.
Now, on his own, janacek, I can turn him around.
And the junior capos will follow him.
Why not let me talk to saviano
Me and jimmy go way back.
You do go way back.
What would you tell him?
I'd say you're the best candidate.
He just ca n't admit it to your face.
Butch, You're not turning on me, are you?
I'm just asking.
Royston, what are you doing out of your cell?
Hey, cut it out!
Royston, is that your name?
The poor man can walk and talk, but all he remembers are lines
Same electroshock technique As frogman but with slightly less drastic results.
It's like whoever's doing this is improving their methods.
Or maybe their process is so haphazard, they do n't know
One man ends up a vegetable,
While the other one recites shakespeare on a loop.
I do n't understand what an inmate gains
From scrambling up another inmate.
You should stay on the female wing for a while.
There's no reason to put yourself in danger.
I'm perfectly capable of protecting myself.
Besides, my patients need me.
Made me focus on the inmates, But I think it's a misdirection.
I think I should be focusing on the staff.
There will be some drama.
But, wait, I'm staff.
What if it's me?
It's not you.
You're not the type.
Cop skills, huh?
You can read people.
It was an inmate.
Your job is to oversee inmate security.
You're not authorized to conduct an investigation Of the staff.
You're trying to force my hand.
You want me to call the police.
I already called'em.
Barbara, you need to wake up.
I got you coffee.
Have you spoken to jim recently?
Renee, you do n't Have to be jealous of jim.
I'm over him.
This was a mistake.
I should have never let it go on for this long.
No. I mean, you're...
No, you are absolutely right.
This - this was a mistake.
This has been a really long process for me,
And I've worked too hard to get right with myself.
I - I wanted this to be good, but I ca n't fall back now.
The drinking, the drugs.
We're toxic together, you and me.
Please, renee, stop.
There's no need to say another word.
I am sorry that I interfered with your process.
Barbara, you need help I ca n't give you right now.
For you, please.
Where's my purse?
You do n't need to go.
Take time to get yourself together.
I am perfectly together, thank you.
I am just toxic, that's all.
Now, where's my damn purse?
Calm down, please, all right?
I can dig that.
Let me take a good look at you.
Lord have mercy, a screw.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, you were n't exaggerating.
Nobody of authority called on you, sir.
This is not a police matter.
You must be director dr. Lang.
This is third degree assault, at the very least.
A friend of yours, is it?
Your job here was already hanging on a thread.
This is the end of your career in law enforcement.
Take it easy, hot shot.
Officer gordon did the right thing.
Why would n't he call the police?
It is gerry, is n't it?
Now, did you do this terrible thing, gerry?
That does n't even merit a reply.
No, I did not do this terrible thing.
Now, why would I do this?
Exactly, officer gordon.
Gerry, I think we're gonna have to take you Down to the precinct -- you're raising a lot of questions
As of this moment, this is an official gcpd investigation.
You, sir, will cooperate or face arrest.
Like old times, huh?
All we need is a bottle of applejack.
We're still kids, chasing girls in harlow park.
We caught a couple of hot ones, huh?
Thanks for meeting with me.
What did you tell your boss - lady?
I suggested I reach out to you.
Talk some sense into me?
It's a new dawn.
Yeah, like that.
She's not wrong, you know?
You really want falcone's job?
Since we were kids, I love you like a brother.
I love you, too.
That's why I trust you.
And that's why I say to you with love...
There's no way she gets the chair.
She's a smart cookie, but she's
I mean, come on, butch, without
What are you offering?
Drop fish, come over to us.
The club -- all the businesses attached -- they're yours.
That's day one.
What else you want?
That's a good question.
Do n't think too long, huh?
What are you guys doing?
Thank goodness you're here.
There's been some silly mistake.
Examine your soul, penguin.
My patron, don maroni, is obviously Unaware of my predicament.
A simple phone call would Resolve things, I'm sure.
But, see, I like having you here. cause I can sit at my desk
Like a bonsai tree.
What's a bonsai tree?
So... Did you see our friend?
I'm working him.
Just give him a little time.
All right, doctor,
Pretend I'm an ignoramus.
Should n't be too hard, hmm?
Explain to me this whole crazy electric needle business.
When a real doctor like you does it,
What's it supposed to do?
Electroshock therapy is a common procedure For mood and behavior alteration.
But skilled Surgeons can elicit very specific responses.
But those inmates Were n't treated by a skilled surgeon.
There are no Skilled surgeons amongst the inmates. Or the staff.
You're a skilled surgeon.
I have n't opened a body since med school.
I'm just messing with you.
I do n't think you're the man behind this.
No, you're not the type to break rules.
But you're hiding something.
Well, everybody's hiding something.
Do n't play tag.
You're right, detective.
And the things I'm hiding?
I'll never tell you.
Yes. And if you know what's good for you, You wo n't dig any deeper.
I do n't want to hit any power lines.
Do n't have to tell me twice.
It has something to do with the case at hand.
Great, thank you.
You look so pale.
The files seem to be incomplete.
I'm wondering if there's more in the basement.
Blueprint says there's a records office down there.
Nobody's been down there for ten years.
Do you know the way down there?
All right, suppose you had to pick out One member of your staff as the culprit.
Who would it be?
It was n't a staff member.
Just the first face that pops to your mind.
They're good people.
I know them well.
They've all been with me for more than five years.
We all came to arkham together.
You just saw someone.
Oh. no, she could n't..
Everybody's in their cell.
We're going on an adventure To the basement.
Well, that sounds fun.
Dr. Thompkins, what did I tell you earlier?
You should go home.
I need you to find the main entry guard,
Tell him to hit lockdown,
Then get out of the building, quick.
Dorothy duncan is n't staff.
She's an inmate.
Get over here now.
jim, behind you.
What the hell Do you think you're playing at?
Is jim gordon there?
But I'm sorry, jim is kind of busy right now.
Can I take a message?
No, that's okay.
I'm a friend of jim's.
M.E. 's got her in the morgue.
When dorothy duncan was a 16 - year - old nursing student, She killed five kids with poison candy --
She's spent over half her life at arkham.
When the asylum closed, there was chaos.
She must have just hunkered down in the basement
Forensics is sweeping the basement level Looking for her lair.
What was she trying to do?
Maybe she was just trying to find a cure for her own madness.
It's good to see you, jim.
And you got a win, huh?
Yeah, I do n't think my boss is gonna see it that way.
He's working for the king of all cheese grinders.
It's a crying shame, cap -- we need to get him back on the job.
You know I'd bring you back here in a second... If I could.
It's all good, captain.
You do look spiffy in the uniform.
Yeah, if spiffy means dorky.
How about a drink for old times' sake?
Thank heavens you're here.
I've had nothing but a moist towelette Since yesterday morning.
A very sad picture.
You know why you're in there?
You're in there because I put you in there.
But, don maroni, wh-why?
Do you know what hubris is?
I - I thought that was another... Rhetorical... Question.
It's when limping little Chickenbutt second bananas think they're hot stuff.
When dumbass underlings Raise taxes without asking me first.
You raised taxes on fishermen.
That's hubris, my friend.
I'm sorry, don maroni.
I will never do it again.
Let my friends out.
Open the cage, mook.
Holy mother, you stink!
Let this be a lesson to you, yes?
You're a smart monkey... But you're a monkey.
And I'm the zookeeper.
Yeah, you're all right.
Captain, you should see this.
Dorothy duncan. Electrode wounds,
Same gauge as the other victims.
About a month old.
They were hidden by her hair.
This is crazy -- how could she have done this
Well done, aaron.
Exactly like I told you.
Oh, now you are my best work so far.
Hello, dr. Lang.
Sorry I had to run.
I very much wanted to enjoy A proper chat with you before I left, but...
That's show business.
I've been practicing my skills on these sad creatures For a while now.
Electricity is an amazing thing.
It can work wonders.
Nurse dorothy was an early success.
This last time, I think I finally got one just right.
But time to go.
Jim, And I hope to see you around.
﻿All the best, jack gruber.
So, what's the deal, brother, are you in?
You remember when we were 14, We stole all that meat from satriani's?
Yeah, I do.
It was, like, 50 pounds of pork and what not.
Never seen my mom so happy.
Thing is, when I was sharing it out.
There was, like, 15 pounds of prime angus beefsteaks in there.
And I kept it all for myself.
I did n't give you any.
Gave you all the cheap cuts.
I never knew that.
Yeah, it's been bugging me ever since.
Hey, we're talking a long time ago.
I want to say I'm sorry.
I apologize for cheating you out of your beefsteak.
Why did I do that?
Forget about it -- it's okay.
Excuse me, but are n't you Sarah Morton?
I've read all your books --
You must have mistaken me with someone else.
I'm not the person you think I am.
What would you like?
Yeah. and after that in all the directories.
And we will renew. most definitely.
Yes, but he's in a meeting.
I'm in the process of drawing up the contract now and it should be with you shortly.
Yeah, I'm absolutely sure.
Now, you're on what's called "a roll."
You must keep the momentum going.
Take a short holiday, but nothing too long.
Um, let me introduce you.
I'm so pleased to meet you.
my mother adores you.
she's read all your Dorwell books.
Well, Terry, always a pleasure.
We'll speak very soon.
And congratulations again on that award.
I'm sure it's the first of many.
Oh, geez, John.
Very nice to have met you.
And do hurry. my mother's impatiently awaiting the arrival of the newest Inspector Dorwell book.
Hardly the Booker Prize, I know, but it's not bad for a first novel.
I just hope he sells.
And what motto's that?
You drilled it into me 20 years ago.
"Awards are like hemorrhoids.
sooner or later every asshole gets one. "
Did I say that?
my God, you're jealous, are n't you?
You do n't look after me anymore.
Just because I give a little fledgling some encouragement does not mean that I am neglecting you.
Besides, you've never had any problems finding inspiration for the Dorwell series.
You write with such remarkable ease I wonder you need me at all.
Okay, sarah, what's the matter?
You're rolling in it.
The only thing you can find to talk about to me is money.
I do n't give a damn about money... or success!
- I just want to find --
- An inspiring plot.
- It's got nothing to do with inspiration.
Why do n't you confound your critics and write something completely different?
Put Dorwell on the shelf, as it were.
You did n't like the last one, did you?
And you have n't had the balls to tell me.
You know very well I've loved the Dorwell series right from the beginning.
Do you like France?
I like frogs' legs.
Breathe some fresh air.
There's a swimming pool.
Would you come and visit me?
I have got my daughter.
But maybe I'll come for a weekend.
- Are you marcel?
Hello, I'm sarah morton.
- How was your trip?
- may I carry this?
- It's on wheels.
- I'll take the small one.
my car is just outside.
The bedrooms and bath are upstairs, the kitchen's on the left.
I'll let you take a look around.
I turned on the hot water and gas.
If you need anything, you've got my number?
- Yes, John gave it to me.
To go to the village, you can take the footpath I showed you... or use the moped in the garage.
The keys are in the ignition.
Good - bye, madame.
Uh, maybe something lighter?
How about a panache?
No. Just a cup of tea.
In Marseilles. bus service is drastically reduced. but the Metro is running at 75%.
It's the second strike in two weeks... and passengers are growing weary --
Yes, I've arrived safely.
How is the house?
The house is lovely.
The weather's gorgeous.
How is the weather in London?
Does n't stop raining.
Have you met anyone?
No, I have n't seen anyone.
You should n't stay by yourself.
Try to get out.
Look, Father, if there's a problem of any kind, ask mrs. smith for help.
I do n't need anyone's help.
John, how are you?
I should be asking you that question.
so, tell me, how's everything going, darling?
Did marcel come and fetch you?
Yes, but listen.
I have just one thing to say to you, and that's thank you.
You were right, as usual.
Your house is a little piece of paradise.
And I've already begun working.
The idea kept running through my mind while I was on the train.
You know, one of those stupid things that just latch on and wo n't let go.
I do n't know where it's heading, but -- so, what's Dorwell up to now?
Well, I'm not ready to talk about it right now.
But I think it might be quite funny.
Anyway, I'm going to wait until I'm sure.
Well, that's marvelous.
Well, I'm glad you're happy.
Have you been out and about yet?
I'm just enjoying the peace and quiet here.
Yeah. so, when are you thinking of coming?
It - - It depends on the work, you know.
Um, look, I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I've got another call coming through.
Now, you take care, and call me when you're ready to read me something, all right?
What are you doing in my house?
I should be asking you.
And my publisher, John Bosload, is letting me this house.
Ah. so you're Daddy's latest conquest.
You're his daughter?
No, he did n't tell me you'd be coming.
I'm here on my own.
and I'm here to work.
Maybe he'll come and visit.
I'm glad he's not here.
Are you going to be staying long?
I do n't have much work these days.
so, which bedroom did you take?
The one upstairs overlooking the pool.
That's the best one.
Well, I'm gonna unpack.
Leave your name, number and any message you might have... and I'll get right back to you.
You could have told me your daughter was coming to your bloody house.
How do you expect me to work now?
I could n't get through to London.
Is there anything to eat?
Personally, I'm gonna go back to bed.
You're not too hot?
I woke you up.
I was just dozing.
You must be working too hard.
Well, thank you for your advice, but I absolutely loathe swimming pools.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I prefer the sea too.
that you could lose footing at any time and be swept away.
There's no excitement, no -- no feeling of infinity.
It's just a big bathtub.
It's more like a cesspool of living bacteria.
No, it's just a bit of dirt and leaves.
So. what are you writing?
I write crime fiction.
Oh. yeah. that's how he makes his money.
And that's how he can afford to buy a beautiful house in France for his daughter to enjoy.
- What is this one about?
In the Luberon with rich English tourists.
Listen, if you do n't mind, I do have work to do.
I leave you alone, miss marple.
I need to make some phone calls anyway.
With Jean - Pierre?
No, I'm going to have lunch in the village.
By the way, I spoke to marcel.
He's coming very soon for the pool.
I'm not going to bother her.
Anyway, it's a big house.
Did you ring mom?
I'm telling you, she's still waiting, so hurry up.
Yes, c'est ca.
It's your publisher.
Hello, this is sarah morton.
Could I speak to John, please?
He's gone out.
He told me not to bother you.
He said I should leave you alone so you could work.
I need peace and quiet to concentrate.
And since we share the same living space, I must ask you just to go about your business without getting in the way of mine, hmm?
I mean, this house is certainly big enough for the two of us.
I was only trying to be polite and make friends.
But if you prefer I do n't -- I do n't prefer anything!
I just want to work on my book in peace.
That's too bad, though, because I just bought loads of nice food.
I guess I have to eat my foie gras all alone.
- We're almost there.
- I'm wasted.
Yeah, I swear!
Ca n't you turn the music up?
No, the old bag's sleeping upstairs.
I made some coffee, if you like.
I hope we were n't too loud?
I ca n't understand a word.
I'd love to, but I've really got to go.
And there's that woman.
- You saw her?
- Yeah, she's outside.
- she's a foreigner?
- Not bad looking.
It's not far. see you later.
- Call me sometime.
Are you from around here?
Have you been there?
- The marquis de sade's castle is there.
I've heard about it.
It's practically in ruins now, is n't it?
But there's a nice panoramic view of the Luberon.
I'll let you finish.
Oh, it's you.
Your bedroom's not big enough for you?
Yes, it is, but he snores like a pig.
I could n't get to sleep.
I've come for the pool.
- Hi, marcel.
- You're back already?
- I was sick of work.
This is sarah, a friend of my father's.
Yes, we've met.
Are you cleaning the pool today?
Is n't that what you wanted, Julie?
sarah wants to swim, but it's too dirty for her.
I forget her name.
That's it. Julie, right.
Check out in the backyard by the pool.
I believe she's getting some air.
Bernard, this is marcel.
- He's my dad.
Come on, marcel!
Do I have to ask for your permission?
Well, it would be nice if you did n't make any noise when you came home.
I pity your mother.
Well, I imagine having a daughter who comes home with a different man every night must be difficult for a mother.
Well, you imagine wrong.
You're just a frustrated English woman... who writes about dirty things but never does them.
You can shove your uptight morals up your ass.
I was worried when you did n't come home.
Are you gonna tell my daddy?
Yes, maybe I will.
He would love it.
I'm not so sure about that.
How can you be so naive?
He's the king of orgies.
Did n't you know?
Would you like to go out to dinner tonight?
Yes, I'm coming.
You're working, as usual.
I was just rereading an old piece.
This is my underwear.
I found it in the garden near the pool.
I see the waiter is n't here tonight.
It's Franck, a boy from Lacoste.
During the off - season he only works days.
Do you know him well?
I see him around sometimes.
You seem to know just about everyone here.
I've spent my whole childhood here.
But not with John?
He abandoned us, my mother and I.
He just came here for the summer on holiday.
He lives his life, I live mine.
Where does she live?
Why are you so interested now?
I was angry with you -- Well, actually, I was angry atJohn... for not really telling me about you or her.
He's the one you're interested in.
When someone keeps an entire part of their life secret from you, it's fascinating and frightening.
I do n't deny that I want to know more.
But do n't count on me to tell you any secrets.
If you wanna know something, you should askJohn.
I'm not asking anyone anything.
You may pretend you do n't care, but I can see you're hoping I tell you some things about my father.
Actually, I'm more interested in your mother.
Why do n't you live with her in Nice?
I was 1 3 the first time.
I fell in love once.
We were 1 6.
He was... handsome, romantic, coming from Paris.
His name was Christian.
I was crazy about him.
I wanted him to take me, but I was too fast for him.
He was a baby.
He did n't know how to do those things yet.
He came on me after two seconds. so I dumped him.
He wrote to me for a year, but I never wrote back.
I remember once in the fort we built in the forest. he asked me to marry him.
It's stupid. I know.
but it made me cry.
It was the first time anyone --
I'm boring you with my stories.
I'm enjoying it.
What happened to your eye?
some asshole tried to hit me, but I fought back.
He was bleeding like a pig.
Nobody better mess with me, because if they do, I'll mess with them back.
I suppose you do n't want any?
Never judge a book by its cover.
I've done my share of smoking.
I was around in swinging London.
Yeah. my mom already told me about it.
What did she tell you?
Although, I must say, it is quite strange... to be writing a typically English story set in London... while I'm here in this house in such beautiful weather.
my mom wrote a book too, but it was never published.
He told her it was awful, so she burned it.
Did you read it?
It was a bit sentimental, kind of a Harlequin romance, but charming.
What was it about exactly?
About her and my father.
It was a love story with a happy ending.
That's what you give to him, is n't it?
But I like all that too.
Did your mother live in this house?
But once they were truly separated.
she did n't want to come back anymore.
She went to live in Nice.
Anyway. it's really his house.
Did she want him to come and live with her in France?
She wanted him to leave his wife and family in London for her.
ButJohn would never do that.
My mother was terrified to be alone here.
I am like you.
Julie, are you here?
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine who's come for a drink.
I did n't know you were atJulie's.
I forgot to tell you, sarah's a writer friend of my father's.
You did n't tell me you write.
Could you make us a drink, sarah?
sit down, Franck.
make yourself at home.
This time you're serving me.
What shall we drink to?
To sarah's book.
Oh, I never discuss a book before it's finished.
How about the last one then?
A police investigation in scotland.
What was it called?
I do n't know the French title.
In English it was Dorwell Wears a Kilt.
Yeah, really, that's bizarre!
I'll leave you two alone now.
Please, stay for a while.
Good night, Julie.
- Do you want to take a midnight swim?
You would have if she came, would n't you?
stop it, Julie.
- You promise it's not cold?
Take it all off!
Why are you leaving?
- Why are you closed?
But you're usually open.
Franck did n't show up this morning.
- maybe he overslept.
Did you sleep well?
Where did this blood come from?
Here, on the tiles.
That must be mine.
And where did you cut yourself?
- I know a Franck Durin.
He lives just outside of town on the way to Bonnieux.
Do you know if he lives alone?
Franck Durin's a bachelor.
He had a girlfriend, but she's long gone.
I'm looking for your husband.
I need to speak to him.
But I'm not married.
Does n't marcel... John Bosload's gardener, live here?
He's my daddy.
- Is he home?
He's at the swiss people's house.
Would you tell him to call me?
- Thank you, madame.
But maybe I can help you?
- Do you know Julie?
Do you have her mother's number?
Julie's mother is dead.
It's sarah morton.
I'm sorry, miss morton.
John's not available.
Well, where is he?
He's gone out.
I thought you'd gone!
I thought you'd abandoned me.
But you're here!
Julie, I'm not your mother!
Oh, my head hurts.
You must tell me the truth.
I think I killed him.
- Why are you leaving?
- shut up, and get off my back.
You'll have to clean up behind.
You've found them.
I'll take this.
Come on. start digging.
All right. that's done.
I'm going to bed now.
there's something you forgot to burn.
It could be used as evidence.
Did you read it?
No, but I just can imagine.
Well, stop imagining, huh?
We got work to do tomorrow.
I've thought it over.
We have to carry on with our lives as if nothing has happened.
You should call marcel and ask him to come up this afternoon to do some work.
Like cut the grass?
It's important for everything to appear normal... as it was before.
Another thing, did anyone see you with Franck before the two of you came here?
I went to his house.
He lives in an isolated place outside Lacoste.
And after, we came directly here in my car.
Did anyone see you along the way?
Did he have any family?
His parents are dead.
Are you going back to London?
That would look suspicious.
Why are you helping me, sarah?
Well, why would n't I help you?
Do you think they will arrest me?
If you do exactly as I say, I do n't think there'll be any problems.
And why should I believe you?
I came to say good - bye.
I want to let you finish your book.
I'm going to saint - Tropez.
A friend of mine has some work for me in his restaurant.
It's possibly for the best.
Are you going to tell my father?
I've got nothing to tell him.
How did you get that scar on your stomach?
Is that for your book?
I do n't really know why I'm doing this.
it seems like the right thing to do.
I lied to you.
My mother's book was not completely lost.
It did burn. but she kept a copy which she gave to me.
John does n't know I have it.
Perhaps if I give you these pages today.
you will bring her back to life.
I've read it.
You did n't like it, did you?
Oh, come on, John.
Well, I do n't understand what you're trying to say.
And I do n't recognize you in it.
I thought that's what you wanted.
Yes, I know, but I --
I do n't think writing about feelings is your strong suit.
murders, investigations, that's your line of country.
I mean, this is far too subtle.
Where's the action?
Where are the plot twists?
so, what's your advice?
shall I burn it?
Oh, God, you're so melodramatic.
But for the benefit of your career, I do n't think we should publish it.
Let's have another Dorwell.
think of your audience.
That's precisely what I thought you'd say.
Well. there you are then.
You can do better than this.
Actually, I do n't think I can.
I think this is the finest piece of work I've done in a bloody long time.
And because I knew in advance that you would n't like it,
I've signed with Barken.
Unlike you, they love the book.
Why could n't you have told me?
There are a few things that you could n't tell me.
Give it to your daughter.
I've signed it for her.
Good - bye, Debbie.
Bye - bye, sarah.
I'll tell him you're here.
Julia's in reception.
He'll be out shortly.
I've got great news.
I got a job in advertising.
Gosh, what's the pay like?
Oh, come on, people.
If I do n't know who makes the most how do I know who I like the most?
We have interns at Days of our Lives.
So, uh, what do you think they'll have you do there?
It's a training program, but they hire the people they like.
- There's gonna be some grunt work which will stink.
A grown man getting people coffee is humiliating.
You know, if I did n't already have a job I would've been good in advertising.
I should've written it down.
I wanna wish him good luck on his first day.
And I smelled bacon.
- He just left.
Joey, you're never gonna believe it!
- What is she talking about?
I do n't know, but it sounds great!
No, your agent called.
It's for a play on Broadway.
And in a real theater.
- Is it a good play '?
I read it and did n't understand a single word!
- Yeah, and directing.
Oh, he was so good in that movie of Macbeth.
- You saw that?
- No, but I saw the previews.
- They played it right before Jackass.
- He's done some amazing work.
Oh, I loved him in those phone commercials.
When the monkey hits him in the face with the giant rubber phone.
Maybe the monkey will be at the audition.
Do n't make me more nervous than I already am!
- Can I get you a cup of coffee, sir?
I'm an intern, just like you guys.
Except for the tie, the briefcase and the fact that I can rent a car.
Seriously, you're an intern?
I'm heading in a new career direction and you gotta start at the bottom.
I know I'm a little older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.
Joey, these are the producers.
And as you probably already know, this is Leonard Hayes.
It is so amazing to meet you. I am such a big fan of your work.
Well, I've been blessed with a lot of great roles.
Tell me about it, huh?
"Unlimited nights and weekends!"
Are you making fun of me?
Because I am not a sellout.
I did n't do it for money.
I believe in those phones!
I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service.
I think you were great in those commercials.
Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role.
- It's true.
When they shoot you out of that can non...
"Hang up that phone!"
- So shall we read?
Top of Act 2.
This is my entrance.
What the hell are you still doing here?
- I think you know.
I am what you made me.
I could go right now.
Oh, I want to, Long Pause but I ca n't.
You're not supposed to say "long pause."
Oh, I thought that was your character's name.
I thought you were, like, an Indian or something, you know, with the...
Thank you so much for coming in.
Sure you do n't want me to do it again?
"I could go right now, mon!"
Leonard, can we talk to you for a moment?
You've gotta be kidding.
See, he ca n't act.
I do n't care if you think he's hot.
If you wanna sleep with him, do it on your own time. This is a play.
No, listen, if you insist on this I will call my age nt so fast on a cell phone connection so clear, he's gonna think I'm next door!
Uh, thank you so much for whispering for my benefit.
If you tell me what I did wrong, I would love to work on it and try it again for you.
And also, how you doing?
Would you please just give me another chance?
I really wanna get better.
Well, if you wanna come back today... -... here are my notes.
Um, you're in your head.
I really doubt that.
It's that you're not connected with anything in your body.
- It's a race.
- Do n't be afraid to explore the vertical.
And do n't learn the words.
Let the words learn you.
Could n't I just sleep with the producer?
Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?
Oh, I ca n't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katie.
- Oh, I hear divorce bells.
Give me your wallets, and there wo n't be a problem.
Okay, just relax, Phoebe.
Oh, my God, I ca n't find my wallet!
- All right, lady, now give me your purse.
- Lowell, is that you?
Ross, this is my old friend, Lowell, from the streets!
- Ross, nice to meet you.
Yeah, a real pleasure.
- I ca n't believe you're still doing this.
But I quit smoking.
You look like you're doing well.
Phoebe, you used to mug people?
Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up.
- How'd the audition go?
- Oh, he said I was n't urgent enough.
Everything I did was horizontal, and I should be more vertical.
- Oh, and he said that I should think less.
- Well, so far so good.
Honey, I'm old!
I am so much older than these other interns.
I ca n't compete with them.
So you're a little older.
Look at the positive. You have all this life experience.
Yes, but I do n't think life experience is gonna help me with these.
It's like they're on fire!
I need ideas on how to sell them.
Which I ca n't do because no self - respecting adult would ever wear these.
I'll give you $500 for them.
- What am I supposed to do?
- Come on, sneakers are easy.
- You wear them all the time.
- They're not called sneakers anymore.
They're called "kicks" or "skids." I think I heard somebody say "slorps."
They've got wheels that pop out from the bottom so you can roll around because apparently walking is too much exercise.
Kids! Roll your way to childhood obesity! "
Would you help me try to sell these?
That's not what they're looking for.
Hey, that would work on me.
Why do you think I buy Mrs. Butten / vorth's? - Hey.
- You'll never guess what just happened.
- Phoebe and I got mugged!
- Are you okay?
Yeah, because Phoebe knew the mugger.
How do you know a mugger?
I'm sorry, I have friends outside the six of us.
Know how she knew him?
Because Phoebe used to mug people.
Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff...
- That is awful.
- I was n't rich like you guys, okay?
I did n't eat gold and have a flying pony.
I had a hard life.
My mother was killed by a drug dealer.
- Your mother killed herself.
- She was a drug dealer.
It was a good thing Phoebe knew him.
This must have brought back some bad memories for you, Ross.
And it was pretty traumatic.
It was outside St. Mark's Comics.
Ahem, Wonder Woman.
And the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book, Science Boy.
What was his superpower again?
A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
I better get to class.
Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way?
Actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane Street.
That's where Stabby Joe works.
But can I just run to the bathroom?
Leonard does n't wait.
- But I am bursting with Yoo - hoo!
- What the hell are you still doing here?
- I think you know!
- Oh, you sick bastard!
- I am what you made me!
- I could go right now.
- Oh, I ca n't.
Plus which, you've got this, I do n't know, this squirmy quality you bring to the character I could n't have imagined.
Come back tomorrow for the final callbacks.
Do all of this, what you got going now. But you know what?
I do n't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go!
I ca n't explain it.
- Hey. Putting on the sneakers to get in the young mindset, see if it sparks anything.
- Oh, anything yet?
- Yes, how's this?
"They're so uncomfortable, it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet."
You're probably wondering what I'm doing.
No, that seems about right.
Yesterday at my audition, I had to pee.
Apparently, that makes me a good actor.
I got a callback, so I'm drinking everything.
- Mm-hm. -... that eggnog in our fridge was great!
- Joey, that was formula.
- We gotta get more of that.
These are n't half bad.
You should suggest these to Ralph Lauren.
Okay, first of all, that's stupid.
Second, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
I feel younger already.
Yeah, I think I broke my hip.
No one ever asks me that.
I really wanna know.
Well, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene...
All right, nothing is worth this.
Okay, you know that, um, girl that mugged you when you were a kid?
What are you talking about?
It was n't a girl.
It was this huge dude.
You do n't have to lie anymore.
- No, it was n't.
- "Give me your money, punk!" - Oh, my God, it was you!
But, you know, if you think about it, it's kind of neat.
I mean, well, it's just that I've always felt kind of like an outsider.
You know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now you and I have a great one.
It's not the best!
I do n't know what to say.
There's nothing you can say!
That was the most humiliating thing ever.
And then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hot tub and start making out with each other.
You did n't mention the shoes.
You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes.
- He's about my age.
So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control.
Maybe he falls. Maybe he hurts himself.
Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes.
He jumps over the old guy and laughs.
"Not suitable for adults."
- Well, Chandler, that's great.
Or, man who's two years younger than me.
You see, that has a clear selling point.
It appeals to our key demographic.
- How did you come up with that?
I was just trying to get into a young mindset, and stuff started to flow.
We'll see all of you tomorrow.
The cold weather hurts my hip.
I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a sec?
Sure, go ahead.
Sure, go ahead.
I just really wanted to apologize again.
And also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.
Oh, my God! "Crap from the street!"
In this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell or smoke.
Anyway, I was looking through it, and I found Science Boy.
- I never thought I'd see this again.
It's all here!
I guess I just thought it was really good.
And maybe it would be worth something one day.
You really thought Science Boy was worth saving?
But you should know I also have a jar of Vaseline and a cat skull in here.
Still, this is amazing!
- I need an answer!
- I ca n't tell you something I do n't know.
- I need an answer now!
- You want an answer?
She never loved me.
She only loved you.
You knew this all along and you never told me?
I can never forgive you, or myself.
I have nothing to live for.
- The part is yours.
Now I really got to get going.
You can relax now.
You do n't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn.
On a Saturday afternoon?
I was in the house!
You did n't happen to tell...
- Everybody we know?
A car from the Corinthian Casino picked him up.
That's Linderman's casino.
What are n't you telling me?
Linderman said that he needed Micah for a job.
No, this is your fault!
I'm done with you.
I'll get Micah my damn self.
You're the one that can save Micah.
He's gonna get killed if he goes alone.
Not that I mind the babysitting, but do n't you think this is a waste of my talent?
Who was on the phone?
It was Mr. Linderman.
He wanted to make sure that you were ready for tomorrow.
Is n't that nice?
I do n't want to do this.
I want to go home.
That's the last that I want to talk about it, okay?
You know that I would never let anything bad happen to you, right?
So, have you thought about my offer?
Are you ready to come to work for us?
You're going to show me everything you do, everything you know, and I'm going to use it to help me stop Sylar.
And why would I do that?
You raided my father's office in Chennai, planted Eden as my next door neighbor.
You want what I have, the formula.
I can find more of them.
You're the one who needs me.
Some people died because you led Sylar right to them.
Is that a no?
What choice do I have?
There's someone you need to meet.
Your father led Sylar right to her.
How did she survive?
Well, luckily, we got to her.
That's what we do.
We find people with abilities, help them, protect them.
You need to get her to a doctor.
A doctor ca n't help her.
I'm thinking maybe you can.
I'm a geneticist. I would n't know the first thing about this.
Molly's virus is very rare.
It prevents her from accessing her ability.
There's been one other case, an Indian girl, 1974.
You're trying to manipulate me?
None of this is going to help.
Molly is the only one who can stop Sylar.
Thinking about the future, my future.
Can I come over?
I'll see you soon.
I can hear you.
Whoever you are, come on out.
You're lucky I did n't leave your ass stuck in the wall after what you've done.
It's where Linderman restores his art.
He usually hangs out in here.
Is that supposed to be...
Our fourth grade report card.
School photos and medical files.
He's tracked our entire life.
This finally makes sense.
No, this is crazy.
Nobody does what you and I can do.
What Micah can do, nobody.
It was n't real.
It was all Linderman's science experiment.
All this time Linderman's just been playing with our lives.
Linderman obviously is n't here.
Linderman went to New York.
There is some note about Petrelli on election day.
Let's get Micah the hell out of there.
I'm Dr. Suresh, and I need to take some blood, if that's okay.
I want to stop the man who hurt your family and who tried to hurt you.
You ca n't stop the boogeyman.
He sees into your soul, and then he eats your brain.
Well, you know who can stop the boogeyman?
I hear you have an amazing ability.
It's not so amazing.
They ask me where people are, and I find them.
But it does n't work right now.
Because the boogeyman, he likes to hide.
But if you can tell us where he is, we can make sure he never comes back again.
You're different from the other doctors.
So, you're telling me this guy Ted Sprague blew up your house?
Maybe I'm not the bomb.
Maybe this guy Ted Sprague is.
Maybe we can stop him.
You said you had a dream that you blew up New York City.
Yeah, I also dreamed that I could fly.
We know how that turned out for you.
The election is tomorrow.
We need to find him.
You've been through a lot, and you're very brave.
I just want you to know that I admire that.
Oh, thank you, Lord, for bringing my Gabriel home safe.
If I'd known you were coming, I would have straightened up more.
I brought it from Texas.
One more, and I have the continent.
I'm just missing Oregon.
I hear it's beautiful there.
The clock's broken.
It was Dad's.
It just needs a little attention.
I have n't done anything.
You've traveled the world.
Some of us only get to see it in snow globes.
I'm tired of traveling.
I think I might stay here.
Why would you ever come back?
I'm gonna make you a sandwich.
Do you want tuna fish?
Maybe he could get you a job.
I have a job.
I ca n't be an investment banker.
You could be anything you want.
Who could forget you?
You're making a tuna sandwich.
I asked you not to.
Maybe I do n't have to be special.
That's okay to just be a normal watchmaker.
Ca n't you just tell me that's enough?
Why would I tell you that when I know you could be so much more?
Should n't we be looking for Ted?
The FBI and police are n't going to believe us.
He can evacuate the people.
That's the man my father works for.
We gotta get out of here.
We do n't know what's happening in there.
And why would you think that?
All the pundits think I'm gonna lose.
And this morning my brother tells me about a fella named Ted Sprague.
We know all about Sprague.
My father took a bullet to keep me from that man, and now he's with Nathan.
It ca n't be what you think.
Why do you keep running back to him?
The truth is, you have no idea what's gonna happen.
You want to blow up half of New York.
I have to find a nuclear man, and I do n't know if I can contain all that power.
Because if we save ourselves, who's gonna save everyone else?
Why are you asking me to make this sacrifice?
For the best of reasons.
I know that you just want what's best.
How'd you do that?
I can make you see anything I want.
But if you do n't listen to what Mr. Linderman says, well, I'll show you things that'll seriously mess you up for life.
So you need to behave.
What if I told you that I can be special?
You can never hurt anyone.
There's a lot of things that I can do that you do n't know about.
I have something to show you.
I know how much you love snow globes.
I did n't mean to frighten you.
You ca n't help me either.
No, actually, my father did find a cure.
It's called an antibody.
It's hiding, like the boogeyman.
It's my sister, Shanti.
She's very pretty.
This is the first time I've ever seen her.
She died before I was born.
Am I going to die?
It'll protect you from the boogeyman.
I'm sorry I scared you. Just come out and talk to me. Please.
Tell me why I would do that.
You're not Gabriel.
You're damned, and I want you out of my house.
Mom, calm down.
I want my son.
What did you do with my son?
Give me back my boy.
You were in the loft.
Why are you following me?
I must stop you.
You found the cure.
It was in me.
Sometimes, when a mommy and daddy have a sick child, they have another baby, a healthy baby with healthy antibodies.
And if we're very lucky, the healthy baby's blood will heal the sick baby.
I think I figured a way for you to save the world.
That's how I save the world, that's your plan?
I can handle Ted.
Right through the back of the head.
You know the spot.
The same place you pulled the piece of glass from.
My destiny is not to shoot you.
The universe can not be that lame.
You can not run away from who you are, Claire.
This bomb is happening.
How can you be so sure?
Because I can draw the future.
I met a guy who can do it, now I can do it, you see?
It's happening around the election, unless you stop it.
I can never forget that face.
Ted is here in New York.
I did n't think I'd see you till later tonight.
I was just working on the speech, some details of the concession.
I'm not talking about the election.
He said you're getting cold feet.
It's natural to feel ambivalent.
Nobody expects you to feel otherwise.
So I wanted to give you perspective.
You know about Linderman's plans?
A lot of people put time and care into making this a reality.
But I do know everything about you.
And I know what you're capable of.
You think I'm a mass murderer?
President Truman dropped two atomic bombs on Japan to end World War II.
I ca n't accept this.
So how could you possibly believe this bomb could actually heal the world if you have no faith in the idea of destiny?
The people will look back on what you do as the freshman congressman from New York, and they will thank you for your strength, for your conviction, for your faith.
In my day, we called it being presidential.
Can you be the one we need?
I can be anything.
I can even be president.
There's no sign of him.
I ruined everything because of what I am.
When I met you, I finally felt like I was part of something.
I felt the same thing when I met you.
He's gotta make it stop.
What, are you kidding me?
I live for Sundays.
The whole family is together.
We're all watching the game.
Yeah, it drives me crazy.
I just did n't appreciate it or you before.
But you also blew it.
We can get it back.
We're gonna get it back.
It's gonna be better now.
I'm better now and I hope you are too.
I'll be there in a minute.
That's true love.
That's when I had long hair.
People say I talk about hair too much.
It's the way I want it, but he cut it back.
Did n't tell him that.
And he's getting used to the routine here.
I do n't want him to get used to the routine here.
Eight months is already long enough.
Can we give Danny a ride to North Philly?
It'll be fine.
Hello, Mrs S. An honour to finally meet you.
Danny was in for assault because of crystal meth and alcohol.
That's when I was an x - ray technician and I had my ADD and my anxiety.
I had a lot of access to medication and I took advantage of it.
That's when my hair was long.
My hair only grew when I was older.
When I was younger, my hair did n't grow...
- It looks great now.
- You like it?
- It's good now.
You're going the wrong way.
Are you sure about that?
I'll bring him back right away.
You lied to me, Pat.
Danny's not allowed to leave.
- Do not touch the steering wheel!
Pat, this whole thing was a mistake.
- It's my fault.
He's my friend so he's rooting for me.
I'm having a disagreement with the hospital. We're working it out.
Take me to the hospital, but take Pat home, he's fine.
You'll see, he's fine.
Can we stop at the library?
I wanna read Nikki's English high school syllabus.
Mom, it's a good thing.
﻿I'm remaking myself.
What happened to DeSean Jackson?
- Come on, tell me that one.
I mean, he celebrates before he's even in.
Your team does that all the time.
They got an inferiority complex.
Because we're America's team.
- We're in Philadelphia.
- What's more American than a cowboy?
He stood in the storm with a kite.
If he was n't on a 100 dollar bill, nobody would know who he is.
I did n't even touch them.
- I do n't touch them.
I do n't know why you need so many.
Hey! Ah, there she is.
- Where is it?
Well, we do n't want them to steal that.
- You still got yours?
- Yeah, I got mine.
So you do n't talk to me?
- Did n't tell Dad you're picking me up?
- Do n't worry about that.
- The court said yes.
Yeah, but what did the doctor say?
Because the court listens to the doctor.
- The court listens to the doctor... - Dad, Dad, Dad, relax.
- I'm there because of the court.
That's the agreement we made.
It was a plea bargain with the courts.
- It's all under control.
- Well, OK.
- So, what are you doing?
- I'm gonna start a restaurant.
- How you gonna pay for it?
- I'm gonna pay, do n't worry.
- From your bookmaking?
- Who told you that?
- No, I did n't.
Why did you say that to him?
He has the wrong idea.
I'm more concerned about you than anything else.
I'm gonna read Nikki's teaching syllabus and get my old job back.
You know, she... Nikki sold the house.
- Did n't your mother tell you she...?
We're very, very much in love, OK?
Just like you two.
Listen, Patrick, she's gone.
She's not around anymore.
What are you doing, Dad?
- What does that mean?
That takes work and that's the truth.
But now Catherine's pregnant.
They both like to dance, which was boring, but I liked it because they were happy.
He writes another ending.
She dies, Dad.
I mean, the world's hard enough as it is, guys.
Hard enough as it is.
Ca n't somebody say, "Hey, let's be positive?"
"Let's have a good ending to the story?"
Pat, you owe us an apology.
I'm not gonna apologise for this.
You know what I will do?
Apologise on behalf of Ernest Hemingway because that's who's to blame here.
Yeah, have Ernest Hemingway call us and apologise to us too.
Do us a favour, do n't read for a while.
Why are you wearing a garbage bag?
- Gon na go run now.
Wait, you have to fix this window.
Get in the car.
You have to go to therapy.
You ca n't live with us and not go.
Is that song really playing?
We have music sometimes.
That song is killing me.
- Could you please turn it off?
- Do n't have the controls.
- Did Dr Timbers put you up to this?
Is there a speaker here?
Is the speaker here?
I'll fix all this, OK?
That was a messed - up thing you did, Dr Patel.
You can call me Cliff.
- Yeah, Cliff, that's not the way to meet people, OK?
Why do n't you write that in...? I do n't know, a little book?
I wanted to see if it was still a trigger for you.
Bravo, it's a trigger.
No, I'm not gonna.
Look, I am not the explosion guy, OK?
My father is the explosion guy.
I'm not that guy.
- I had one incident.
- But one incident can change a lifetime.
But I'm ready. I'm ready to take responsibility for my side of the street.
- She just needs to take responsibility.
- What's hers?
I come home from work after I left early, which I never do, but I got in a fight with Nancy, the principal.
I come home and what's playing? The song.
The song that you so charmingly played out here for us.
That's playing. I do n't think anything of it.
I come home, what do I see?
I walk in the door and I see underwear and clothing, a guy's pants with his belt. And I walk up the stairs .
And then I look up and see her in the shower.
I think, "That's sweet. She's in the shower.
Maybe today we will. "
And you know what he says to me?
So, yeah, I snapped.
I almost beat him to death.
And I'm parallel to my father?
All right. Can you talk about something that you did before or after?
With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God.
And the shower incident happened, everything snapped, so I then realised that, "Oh, wow, I've been dealing with this my whole life."
And without any supervision, I've been doing it all on my own with no help.
- That had to be hard.
- Yeah, it's a lot to deal with, especially when you do n't know what is happening, which I do now.
You have to take your medication.
I will call them.
- They'll come for you.
- You would n't do that.
- Why call them?
I'm clear without it.
I do n't like the way it makes me look.
Just take the medication.
I'm doing it with my physicality.
Working out, that's what I'm doing.
- Why is he wearing a garbage bag?
I'll watch the beginning of the game.
What's in your hand?
I want my son to watch with me, sue me.
No, just sit down.
I'm not superstitious. A small thing that I do.
If I make money what's the difference if I do this?
It's a small thing.
I'm making crabby snacks and homemades.
You're meant to be here.
That's why you came home.
I'm the reason?
I do n't think so.
Yeah, Tommy. Tommy, yes, yes.
Yup. No, no.
- Can I do an interview - on mental illness?
- That's him.
- Guy who's having the problem?
Pat, do n't look for Nikki.
Get out of here with that camera.
- Do n't look for Nikki!
It's my lucky day.
Look at you working on a Sunday.
- How are you? Hey.
I just came by to say hi, I'm ready to work.
I'll work, I'll sub, I'll work history, whatever.
Let me give you a hand.
- I got it.
- Let me ask you something.
- Does Nikki still work here?
- Ca n't tell you. - But Doug Culpepper is.
- Why would you tell me that?
Are you being a troublemaker?
You look good. Did you lose a lot of weight?
OK, I'm better.
- Not a complainer, I'm positive.
You have to give it time.
- People will get over it.
It'll work out.
- I'll take that as a silver development.
- That's a silver lining.
- Welcome back, man.
- I'm out.
Yeah, you're "out" out?
I did n't recognise you.
You know, she had the baby.
I'm really glad you're back.
I really need someone to talk to.
Come see the baby.
Veronica wants to make dinner for you.
Congratulations on the baby but I'm not buying the invitation.
Because you think Veronica still hates you?
I know Veronica still hates me.
What are you doing?
- OK, it's a little true.
If you think she still hates you, you're wrong because why would she invite you to dinner, hm?
- Did you invite him?
Well, can he make it?
I do n't know yet! - Can you make it next Sunday?
- I'll see you next Sunday.
- You are still in touch with Nikki, right?
- Does Veronica still talk to Nikki?
- Get in here, please. I need you.
You're in this house, show some respect for what I do.
And we should spend time together. I'm keeping you out of trouble.
- Things are looking up.
I know. - She might be with that guy.
- No, she might be with him.
- She's afraid.
She does n't wanna talk.
- Put the phone down.
- What are you doing?
You wanna go back?
I got a call to check on this house.
I heard about the restraining order.
It's not OK.
I've been assigned to your case, you'll see a lot of me.
Do yourself a favour.
Respect the restraining order.
You hear what he just said?
You have a restraining order.
- Yeah, I know.
- Since when do cops have cards?
Tell me, would you like to be a guy who goes back to jail or to the hospital?
- Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape, get my life in order, then she's gonna be with me.
Pat, there's a possibility, I want you to be prepared for it, she may not return.
True love is about letting her go and see if she returns.
- Let me say...
You do everything you can, work your hardest.
My friend Ronnie is having this party on Sunday, and it's like a real hoity - toity thing and his wife Veronica's a real stickler for...
Well, that settles that.
I like that jersey.
I wish I was wearing that jersey.
DeSean Jackson's in the house.
- You mean rookie of the year?
Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner.
- Is n't it awesome?
- Not for dinner.
- Look, he got us flowers.
That's sweet, Pat.
We just redid the whole thing.
- Is n't the market down?
You start snapping up commercial real estate, cheap.
You flip it over and that's when you make the money.
Do n't tell anybody.
I feel like I'm getting crushed and... - Crushed by what?
You ca n't be happy all the time.
- Do your best, you have no choice.
- Not true at all.
I hope you're OK with Veronica's sister coming over.
- What happened to Tommy?
- How'd he die?
- Do n't bring it up.
- No, how did he die?
- How did who die?
- I'm not flirting.
I did n't think you were.
I see you made an effort. I'm gonna be better with my wife.
I wanna acknowledge her beauty.
I never used to do that.
Gon na do that.
We're gonna be better than ever, Nikki.
- I just got fired, actually.
- Oh, really?
I mean, I'm sorry.
How'd that happen?
Does it really matter?
- Let's go see the house.
- Let's go for the tour.
I've been planning this forever.
I love our house.
Guess what it is.
Oh, it's a television.
- It's a computer screen.
It's a drawer where they pull out dead bodies, shoot them with formaldehyde.
- Where would the body go though?
In the middle of the wall?
We have a port in every room.
Who does n't have an i Pod?
I do n't have an i Pod.
I do n't have a phone.
They think I'm gonna call Nikki.
- I would call Nikki.
I'm gonna give you one of my iPods.
Give me your iPod.
Of all the rooms there are i Pod ports in,
I'm happy you brought us into the bathroom.
I can play music in any room.
Can you play "Ride the Lightning" by Metallica?
Pat was a history sub at the high school, Tiffany.
Here's a fun fact.
You know where the term OK comes from?
- Martin Van Buren, eighth president of the United States, is from Kinderhook.
He was part of a club, a men's club called Old Kinderhook.
Pretty cool, right?
Tiffany's been doing this dance thing for years. She's real good at it.
She'll be competing at the Ben Franklin Hotel.
- Why do you have to talk like that?
I'm bragging about you.
- Do n't talk about me in the third person.
- Give me a break.
- I'm right here.
- Wow, wow, wow.
- What meds are you on?
I used to be on lithium, and Seroquel and Abilify, but I do n't take them anymore, no.
They make me foggy and they also make me bloated.
Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor, but I agree, I was n't as sharp so I stopped.
- You ever take Klonopin?
I mean, you are done.
- God, I bet it does.
- I'm tired. I wanna go.
We have n't finished the salad yet or the duck...
I made fire and ice cake.
I said I'm tired.
Are you gonna walk me home or what?
- You mean me?
- Yeah, you. You gonna walk me home?
You have a problem.
- I tell the truth.
- What, I'm not telling the truth?
Um, maybe I should drive them home?
No, you can drive them both home.
Stop talking about me in third person.
You love it when I have problems.
You love it because then you can be the good one.
No, I do n't.
- I just wanted to have a nice dinner.
What is your problem?
I'm tired, I wanna go.
- You really wanna go?
- I really wanna go.
I have n't dated since before my marriage, so I do n't remember how this works.
I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat.
You felt it, I felt it. Do n't lie.
We're not liars like they are.
I live in the addition, separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us.
Old enough to have a marriage end and not wind up in a mental hospital.
You're married? So am I.
No, that's confusing.
Oh, my God. Hey.
Are you OK? Ronnie called.
- I do n't know.
When am I gonna get a phone?
Mom, wake up.
You put it up here?
What about in your father's study?
Do n't go in my study.
Dad, not now.
Would you put it in here?
It's probably in the attic.
Are you going in my study?
It feels to me like you wanna hide my wedding video.
- Please stop yelling.
I'm not yelling, I'm just frustrated! I should have my wedding video!
Anybody can wake up!
I'm not ashamed of it!
Let the whole neighbourhood wake up!
- It's my wedding!
It's my wedding video!
- I'm not hitting him!
I gotta come in.
How are we doing in here, huh?
He's a cop.
It's a medication problem, but he's fine.
Wanna send him back to Baltimore?
He's not allowed to talk about that.
Jesus Christ, who's that?
- Is this a bipolar episode?
- Someone help me!
- You ca n't tell Nikki about this.
- I had to make out a report.
- Hey, sit down.
This guy's chasing me!
- What are you laughing about?
Go back to sleep, the party's over.
Not a reflection of where I'm at.
- That kid with the camera.
Good luck. I gotta write this up.
Come on, do n't write it up.
It's OK, everything is OK.
- Weight lifting accident.
why'd You run by my house?
- Did our conversation get you upset?
You ran by my house.
- I like to run by myself, OK?
- I like to run alone.
- I'm running here.
There's tons of roads to run in.
- I like this road, my neighbourhood.
- Come on, please!
- I'm married!
Your husband's dead!
- Where is your wife?
I'm not the one that just got out of that hospital.
- I'm sorry.
Are you any good at that?
Trouble last night.
- Let me just set the record straight.
He was scared for your mother and you hurt him.
Yes, last night was a mess.
And I think he probably just tried to do his best.
So when you get these feelings, you get to a quieter place with peace with yourself, however you can.
- Yeah, that's easier said than done.
- You have no choice.
- Yeah, excelsior.
Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, OK?
Because you have a restraining order.
What good are you, man?
Why did you have this urgency to see your wedding video?
Maybe you think Nikki's not around and Tiffany's an attractive girl. Get drawn towards Tiffany, you'll spoil your chances of getting Nikki back?
Not bad, Dr Jones.
And she still wears her wedding ring.
Pat, the silver lining thing is yours.
I'm just giving back your words to you.
- and reading books. - No.
If you become friends with Tiffany,
Nikki will think you're a kind, generous, large - hearted person who helps people in need, who is basically thriving.
So if you help Tiffany, it will be good for you.
- I wanted to clarify something.
I just want us to be friends.
You wanna have dinner at this diner?
Gon na get a bowl of your Raisin Bran.
Do you wanna share this?
Why did you order Raisin Bran?
Why did you order tea?
Because you ordered Raisin Bran.
Because I did n't want there to be any mistaking it for a date.
- It can still be if you order Raisin Bran.
- It's not a date.
So how's your thing going?
That was a thing with my parents.
I'm doing really well.
I can get a letter to Nikki.
I see her sometimes with my sister.
It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me.
She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing.
But you would do it?
I'm already on thin ice with my family. You should hear how I lost my job.
How'd you lose your job?
I was very depressed after Tommy died.
It was a lot of people.
We do n't have to talk about it.
- I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.
Can I ask you one more question?
Was it like older women, a sexy teacher who wants to seduce you...? Made me sit on her lap and do things?
You sat on her lap?
- She told you what to do?
Oh, my God.
Nikki hated when I talked like this.
Made me feel like such a perv.
- Maybe we should change the subject.
- I do n't mind it.
But then people were getting in fights in the parking lot at work and in the bathroom. And the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me.
So I accused him of harassment. And then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds.
The song that was playing when my wife - was in the shower with the teacher.
- Heard about that.
My wedding song. When I hear it, I go kind of crazy.
Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing.
So they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of.
I just gotta get a strategy, you know?
What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom?
I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now.
Can I at least finish my tea?
- My tea. Can I finish it?
- Why would she do that?
Was it a test?
It was a test.
How did I do?
I think I did pretty well.
She said you were cool, basically.
No, she said you were cool, but, you know...
- Sort of how you are.
It's fine, relax.
- What do you mean?
Sort of like you?
I hope to God she did n't tell Nikki that.
You think that I'm crazier than you.
You're killing me.
- Keep your voice down.
Look, I do n't think you're crazy, all right?
Yes, you do.
- Just leave me alone.
Can I just explain myself?
I did n't want Nikki to think that I was associated with that behaviour because I've never done that.
You're a hypocrite.
You're a conformist. You're a liar.
I opened up to you and you judged me.
You are an asshole.
- You are an asshole.
Get off of me.
You're harassing me!
He's harassing me!
- He's harassing me.
- Get off me, dude.
- He's harassing me!
- Get off of me.
Come on, what are you doing to these kids?
What are you gonna do about that song?
Gon na go your whole life scared of that song?
It's a song. Do n't make it a monster.
Come on, breathe.
There's no song.
There's no song playing.
Hey, was he messing with you?
No, this was just a joke.
That's not a good thing to do.
What can I tell you?
- You're Tommy's widow?
You're a funny girl.
You wanna get a drink sometime?
- What'd I say?
I'm sorry about what I said.
I know. - You did n't mean it.
- I did n't mean it.
Oh, I really appreciate that, Tiffany.
I know you do.
I'll see you tomorrow?
I'll bet I know what happened if only one is missing.
Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope and one of them took it.
- That's the only answer.
Somebody took an envelope.
- Maybe we should call the FBI.
We'll take a look.
I'll show you what this is.
I'm gonna explain to you something.
- No, it's not OK.
What's everybody making a joke out of this for?
Dolores, you are so beautiful.
Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop.
I wanted to tell you the number.
Did n't wanna wake you, needed an envelope.
You did n't wanna wake me?
He did n't wanna wake me.
Does n't have a problem complaining about Ernest Hemingway.
- Come on, be nice.
Come on, she's making crabby snacks and homemades.
What are you so up about?
Is n't that a good thing?
You're just up.
I do n't know what that is.
Are you taking the proper dosage of your medication?
Am I taking the right dose?
- Taking a little too many or something?
If I was taking that, I'd be on the floor.
Stay for the game.
Spend some family time.
Come on, your dad needs a winner.
I ca n't.
It's the Seahawks.
Put on the jersey and stay, please. Please.
It's important, please.
What are you up to?
What's in the envelope?
What's in that envelope?
I'm on the scoreboard.
I'm playing downfield.
Hey, hey, how you doing?
- What do you want?
- That another creep?
- What do you want, creep?
Beat it. - No, I'm married.
- I know her. I know her.
I have n't heard back.
I just wanna give you my card to give to her.
- He's saying you're being rude.
Sometimes it's OK with girls, they wanna have fun. Sometimes it's not, they got a broken wing, they're an easy target.
In this particular case, I think that that wing is being fixed, my friend.
She's sensitive, smart, artistic.
Let me walk you down to your car.
You're a better guy than this.
She just texted me.
Hey, wait a second.
- You were n't outside.
I ca n't do it.
- I ca n't give the letter to Nikki.
Tiffany, what are you talking about?
What do you mean, ca n't give the letter?
Because what am I getting in return?
You seem like you're a tough girl to me.
- You do things on your own.
- I always get myself in these situations.
I give everything to other people and nobody ever...
I do n't get what I want, OK?
I'm not my sister.
All right, well, ask for you.
What can I do for you?
Tiffany, what do you want me to do?
- Think of something.
There's a thing.
It's a thing. It's a thing.
- It's a dance thing.
- Dance thing, all right.
I do n't have a filter when I talk.
- OK, I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.
But I can only do it if I have a partner.
I'm about to miss it for another year.
What are you talking about?
- I'm not gonna do a dance.
- Took care of that jerkoff at your house.
- Let me ask you, you call him when you're lonely?
Should n't do it.
- Say the same about Nikki?
Not at all like me and Nikki.
How are you in love?
Tell me about that.
The big Nikki love.
Tell me about it. I wanna understand it.
We have an unconventional chemistry. Makes people feel awkward, but not me.
She's the most beautiful woman I've ever been with.
Yeah, we wanna change each other, but that's normal. Couples wanna do that.
She wanted me to lose weight, stop my mood swings, which I've done.
We would fight, we would n't talk for a couple weeks.
So think about the dance thing.
- And you're here on game day?
They did n't convert me to Mental Hygiene Law admission status within two - thirds of the maximum length of my felony sentence, so I'm out.
- They had to let me go.
- I never understand what he's saying.
OK, jailhouse lawyer, come back, sit down the way you were before.
- What a treat!
- Dad's got you sitting here?
- He calls me "jailhouse lawyer."
- Now you're holding the remote?
Your dad's a genius.
Now, sit up. - And Danny's good luck?
- Danny's from you.
This is your house so it comes down to you.
- Superstition, Danny.
Dad, Dad. She's my friend.
Why would you say that?
Oh, she's a mess.
She does a lot of therapy.
I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie.
- Am I messed up?
You need to deal with it.
Buddy, thank you.
- How many songs is that?
You love the Stranglers.
- It makes me peaceful.
With Nikki, I'm never gonna do stuff like that.
- How you doing, Jake?
Did n't I say you would n't recognise him?
So, listen, I'm sorry that I did n't come see you down at the hospital.
Been helping Pop. He needs a legitimate business.
He needs a tax return.
And it looks like I'm gonna make partner at the firm.
I do n't even know what to say to you anymore. You lost your wife,
I'm getting engaged. I wanna be able to tell you about those kind of things.
We're watching the game.
You know what? I'm just gonna stop talking.
I'm gonna shut my mouth.
- Thank God, finally.
- Yeah, wore it to Ronnie's.
I love that jersey.
- Veronica did n't like it.
- Veronica hates the jersey.
Whatever you do, watch out for that restraining order, OK?
- Do n't let Tiffany get you in trouble.
People like Tiffany, or Danny or me, we know something you do n't know, OK?
- How you doing, Pat?
- I'm taking him back to the hospital.
First of all, check with the latest legal development.
Got a call that they did convert you to Mental Hygiene Law admission status by the deadline. Wait a minute.
Are you an Eagles fan or are you not?
I'm an Eagles fan.
- What's the problem?
We're killing the Seahawks, 27 - 10.
What's the matter with you?
Let him stay, please.
Do n't know what you're talking about.
I'm glad the Seahawks are losing, we're winning, but I gotta take Danny McDaniels back to Baltimore, all right?
He can contest his case from Baltimore.
Not correct about the Mental Hygiene Law.
You guys ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
- All the floors are hard oak.
It has good bounce for dancers.
I'm not that great of a dancer, but who cares?
It's therapy and it's fun.
Walls are good, I can play music really loud without anybody hearing.
- Where do you sleep?
It's a garage, I just renovated it.
When are you gonna give it to her?
The letter to Nikki.
- Probably tonight. - Really?
Ronnie, Veronica and I, we'll see her tonight.
I assume you're a good teacher.
- To your need. All right, start simple.
Start at that corner, walk towards me.
Walk across the room.
- Can we do something besides dance?
- Are you kidding me?
- Deal is a deal.
I know, OK. I was just suggesting that maybe there's a better scenario.
Why do n't you walk towards me like I'm Nikki?
The only way to convey how much you've missed me is by your walk.
By your slow walk.
- Not doing it.
No. That's stupid.
No walk, no letter.
Walk to me like I'm Nikki, come on.
You're not Nikki.
I do n't feel anything.
We were married for three years and five days, and I loved him.
It just felt like we were so different and I was depressed.
I do n't think that makes me a criminal.
And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tyre and he got hit by a car and killed.
Your father wanted you to have this.
It's his living.
Your father expects to spend time with you, Pat.
Football stays out of this place. So does Lord of the Flies.
I'm behind on my syllabus.
You're not gonna read that on my time.
It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch, a shell, and whoever has the conch has power and can talk.
You do n't have the conch, do n't have power.
Then there's a little chubby boy, Piggy, and they're mean, and then there's a murder.
I mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.
That was a great synopsis.
What are you doing here, man?
If one of your two supervising physicians loses their license, your whole adjudication is thrown out.
How'd you know we were here?
- Danny, Tiffany.
- Pat told me about you.
- Is this the girl you wrote about?
You wrote about me?
I'm "the girl"?
- He wrote about you.
- What did he say?
- A little mouthy. - Tell me more about what he said.
- It was just a very general letter.
- Cool. - She's fine. - She is my friend with an F.
Can I see what you guys are doing?
- That's it?
I think, Pat, you should be facing Tiffany.
You gotta come with a little bit more soul.
You should move some more hips.
Can you move a little bit more hip?
Move a bit more.
Come on, Pat. Come on.
A little bit more soul, Pat.
- Black it up, Pat.
- What's that mean?
- You know what it means.
You gotta move your junk.
Got ta see this girl, Tanya.
- Yeah, go see Tanya.
- OK, man, hey.
I want you to win.
Where have you been?
We got a serious situation on our hands, you know that.
We gotta beat the Giants if we wanna have a chance of getting into division, any chance of playing in the playoffs.
Do you realise that?
I did n't realise that.
Yeah, that's the bind we're in.
I mean, I think it would be wise if we spent father - son time reading about the Eagles, talking about them, just to strengthen the good - luck thing that you're in.
Maybe I did n't spend enough time with you growing up.
I spent too much time with your brother.
It might've made you feel worse about your behaviour, but I did n't know anything. I did n't know how to handle it.
That's what all this Eagles stuff is about.
It's about us spending time now.
I wanna do everything I can to help you get back on your feet.
That's the whole point.
I wish you'd watch these games with me so we could talk, we could get into things.
So, look, will you just come downstairs and talk to me and Randy now, huh?
Randy, tell him what I'm doing.
He's betting everything on the Giant game.
The money he needs for the restaurant, - he's betting on the Giant game.
- Tell him why.
Because he believes in you.
- I believe in you, Patty.
I want you to know that.
So I'm gonna bet heavy on this game.
I want you to go to the game with your brother.
- Does he want me to go?
- He told you that?
- He told me, yes.
- With his friends.
- He's not embarrassed? - No.
I'd love to go to the game too, but I'm banned from the stadium. I'd love to see us beat the Giants and take a lot of money from this asshole.
Listen, personally, - I think it's a stupid bet.
I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game.
I just hope you heard what I said.
It's like a family business, it's our family endeavour.
We all stick together on this.
That's how it works.
That's a positive, positive vibe.
I made a commitment about a project, and we have an important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday,
And it's good for me, Dad.
What is this thing you're doing?
Yeah, what is it?
What is this project, hon?
It's a dance thing, OK?
Listen, I need to ask you something.
- I'm gonna pretend that you did n't ask.
These are the two days that you have promised me and we have prepared to nail the big move.
My dad opened up, and it was beautiful and I wanna be of service to him.
Nikki replied to your letter.
But you ca n't read it until after you nail the big move.
It's in the back of my head.
We do n't almost have it, all right?
- I just hope you can handle it.
What was her energy when she gave it to you?
She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared.
I'm just gonna read it out loud, OK?
Because if she says anything that's... - Is that too much to ask?
- I thought you were gonna read it.
"It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of getting it to me through Tiffany."
"This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe."
"I admit you sound terrific and I'm happy you're feeling positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were."
"I was moved to read about excelsior and your belief in happy endings."
"I'm moved by your act of love to read books I taught."
In spite of these developments, if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage.
"Otherwise, I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately."
"Do n't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it."
"I'm glad you're doing so well.
Love, Nikki. "
I think I'm done today, OK?
You would've never done something like this in a million years.
It shows all kinds of skills on so many levels, focus, collaboration, discipline.
It's romantic, like I said it would be.
It's for her.
Thanks for the letter.
I'll see you tomorrow, OK?
Can I use your phone?
- Yeah, kind of.
I'm doing this project with Tiffany. I wanna tell her I'm not gonna be on time.
I'll just borrow Jake's phone.
Guess we're not that different, huh, Dad?
That a bad thing?
No, I think it's a good thing.
Do n't drink, do n't hit anybody.
You'll be fine.
- This is my brother Pat.
- How you doing?
Pat. Pat, what's this I hear about you just getting out?
Yeah! From the loony bin!
He's a good dude.
You better get your brother.
What are you doing here?
- I'm your brother in green, not your therapist.
I'm happy to see you.
Wonderful that you are here.
You can say that again.
I do n't have her phone number.
She brings me down.
You're not gonna throw the marriage away.
There's some love there.
Got ta give it a chiropractic adjustment.
I do n't wanna not be able to say what I wanna say.
This is America, baby.
- Stay here. Stay here.
Break it up or you'll be arrested!
What'd you do?
What did you do?
You said you had it together, you were solid.
I was solid at the game.
What are you talking about?
- It's ruined! It's ruined!
- I'm not a loser.
- We need to talk now.
When you make a commitment, it is not cool to not show up!
I was gonna split my time with my dad and you. - Dad was pulling me in one direction.
That's great for all of them, but all of them did n't make a commitment to me in return for my help.
What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell?
- This is the reason right here.
- I'm why today happened?
- Let's talk about that.
The first night that Pat and I met, the Eagles beat the 49ers handily, 40 to 26.
The second time we got together, the Phillies beat the Dodgers 7 to 5 in the NLCS.
- She's right.
- Next time we went for a run, the Eagles beat the Falcons, 27 to 14.
The third time we got together, we had Raisin Bran in the diner.
- Let me think about that.
Why not think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, 14 to 7?
- He was with you?
We went for a run.
That's all right on all counts.
- Wow. How did you know all that stuff?
- Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed.
I gotta rethink this whole thing.
I did n't trust her before, but I gotta say, now I do.
Oh, now you like her, Dad?
I have to say I do.
Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know?
You made the bet, I won a lot of money, and now your whole family is in turmoil.
You live for this.
You've bet against my father for years.
You're twisting the knife now.
You get off on it!
- A chance to win back everything. - Double or nothing.
Oh, come on, are you kidding?
- I know who his team is.
- When is the game?
- December 28th, last of the season.
Do n't you believe in America's team?
Yeah, do n't you believe in America's team?
But if I win that bet, I win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing.
Excelsior belongs in this house. - Dad. - Not in New York.
Dad, this is toxic.
What do you say?
My Birds, Benjamin Franklin's team, favoured one and a half points.
Give you 3 more.
Patrizio, stop it.
Randy, do n't you take the bet!
- In fact, I'll give you 10 points.
- Take that bet on the Cowboys.
- Dolores, will you stop him?
How could you not take that bet?
Even with 10 points. That's an insane spread to your advantage.
I bet you're such a coward, you wo n't take the 10.
- No, no, no.
You're crazy to give away that many points.
I wo n't take that.
However, wait a second.
How do they run this dance competition?
I do n't know how they score.
This is a high - end dance contest.
Do not put it as part of the parlay.
They go by Philadelphia rules.
Each dancer is scored 1 to 10, 10 the highest, average the four judges' scores.
OK, scores from 1 to 10, right?
And you guys are how good?
The people you're competing against?
They're good. Some of them are professionals.
If I was to say you only have to score 5, I'd be really very generous, right?
No, no. That'd be amazing if we got 5.
Give me a break.
- We ca n't get 5.
- You'll get a 5.
You'll get a 5.
- Win two bets or lose the whole thing.
For Pat Sr. to win, Birds gotta beat the Cowboys, plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a 5 at the dance.
That's very, very manic indeed.
- Pat, you ca n't quit.
Here we are again at the one - yard line.
- There you go.
- What does that mean?
I'm not gonna do it.
You are not a stand - up guy right now.
- If it's me reading the signs...
- You reading the signs?
- You are not a stand - up guy!
I told you not to push it.
He's gotta do this.
He ca n't be a quitter.
Only one way to get him to show.
- What's that?
We have to tell him Nikki's gonna be there.
- That's a lie.
That's no big deal.
So it's a little lie.
- You ca n't do it.
- Well, you know, I did n't approve when you told her where he was running so she could ambush him.
I did n't approve of that, but you did it anyway, so I'm doing this. That's it.
We're gonna tell him Nikki will be there.
- You gotta be part of it.
- We have to do it.
Are n't you nervous to be lying?
But it's for the best.
Hey, what's up?
- Sorry I'm late.
Nikki's gonna be there, you know?
Everything's gonna come together.
We have a dance to do, a parlay.
- Good, let's go.
- Look at the dancers.
Hey, Randy, Jake.
What do we got?
Dallas just tied it with a field goal, 3 - 3.
- I'm worried about the bet.
- Do n't worry about the bet.
Is this Dancing with the Stars?
Well, you knew that.
Maybe you should've scouted them.
You can give me the money now, you know.
Patty, all we have to do is we have to make a 5.
I'll see you up there, OK?
Hey, Pat, Tiffany.
- All right, wish me luck.
- I thought you were doing it.
I thought you were doing it.
We're doing a dance anyway, for God sakes.
I want you to remember everything, all of the good stuff that we have here.
I gotta go find Veronica.
Honey, calm down.
She'll see how well he's doing, maybe she'll lift the restraining order.
- Oh, my God.
- Pat told me.
He told me you should never throw a marriage out the window.
He did not say that.
You gotta give him a chance.
Bartender. Bartender, can I get a vodka, please?
So you want another one?
So, what do you do?
I'm a lawyer.
- Litigator, actually.
Seven-point-six, 7.3, 7.4, and 6.9. For an average score of 7.3.
- Three, two, one!
- I do n't know, Mom.
Mom, I know.
Why do n't you shut up, OK?
- How many drinks have you had?
I do n't know what choices you've made, but deal with it. We're in this.
- We're in what?
I used to think you were the best thing that happened, but now I think you might maybe be the worst thing. - I'm sorry that I ever met you.
They were great and they only got a 7.2.
This is a tough room.
Up next, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Pat Solatano Jr.
All right, let's see the scores for Solatano and Maxwell.
That's too bad, guys.
For an average score of 5.0.
Sorry. Sorry about that, guys.
Come on! Dad, did the Eagles win?
The Eagles won, 44 - 6.
They won, 44 - 6.
Why are they so excited about a 5?
- I'm good. Thanks.
You lost a lot of weight.
- What do you expect?
- Where is she?
I know you do n't wanna listen to your father.
Life reaches out a moment like this, it's a sin if you do n't reach back.
I'm telling you, it's a sin. It'll haunt you the rest of your days like a curse.
You're facing a big challenge in your life now, this very moment.
I do n't know if Nikki ever did, but she sure does n't love you right now.
I love you, Dad.
- Would you just leave me alone?
- I have one more letter for you.
Yeah, just read it.
I know you wrote the letter. "
- Only way you could meet my crazy.
I knew it the minute I met you.
I'm sorry it took so long for me to catch up.
I just got stuck.
I wrote that a week ago.
- You wrote that a week ago?
You let me lie to you for a week?
I was trying to be romantic.
Yeah, I do.
The world will break your heart ten ways to Sunday, that's guaranteed.
Or the craziness inside myself and everybody else, but guess what.
Sunday is my favourite day again.
I think of everything everyone did for me and I feel like a very lucky guy.
What are we talking about here?
Do another parlay if you make it to the next round.
- No, that was me.
No, I played the jack.
Put the breadcrumbs, the garlic in the steak, - and you roll it up with the toothpicks?
For maybe three hours, plus.
I got you, you're all down.
He's moaning and groaning.
The restaurant's happening because of Randy so everything's good.
This quest, this need to solve life's mysteries when the simplest of questions can never be answered.
Why do we dream?
Perhaps we'd be better off not looking at all.
Not dwelving, not yearning.
That's not human nature.
Not the human heart.
That is not why we are here.
How is he doing?
I'm sorry, did I scare you?
I keep having these amazing dreams everytime I close my eyes and...
He likes me reading the stock page.
Is he even conscious at all?
It's been a week now.
A couple more days maybe.
You know I do n't know what he'd do without you.
You're like a son to him.
Yeah, well, that would make us like brother and sister, it'd be a little ankward if I ever wanted to ask out.
- I'm dating somebody and I...
No, really, it's okay.
I need to change his IV.
Man is a narcissistic species by nature.
We have colonized the 4 corners of our tiny planet.
But we are not the pinacle of so - called evolution.
That honor belongs to the lowly cockroach.
Capable of living for months without food.
Remaining alive headless for weeks at a time.
If god has indeed created himself in his own image, then I submit to you that god is a cockroach.
They say that man uses only a 10th of his brain power.
Another percent and we might actually be worthy of God's image.
Unless of course that day has already arrived, the human genome project has discovered that tiny variations in man's genetic code are taking place at increasingly rapid rates.
Teleportation, levitation, tissue regeneration, is this outside the realm of possibility?
Or is man entering a new gateway to evolution?
Is he finally standing at the threshold of true human potential?
I'm out of time.
I ca n't help it.
You know they can fire me too if they like.
But there is something to it, Merad.
- It's your father.
Driving a taxi in New York City is a very dangerous job.
The wrong fare, the wrong time, we may never know what really happened.
You know I spoke to him 2 days ago.
He was convincing someone was following him, trying to steal his research.
He died because of his thesis.
- That's crazy!
The man left his family, discredited his career to chase wild theories halfway around the world.
To his apartment, to get his papers and research.
He was this close to finding the first of them.
He tracked him to Queens, New York.
Mohinder, listen to me.
Your father was my colleague and my friend.
A respected professor, a brilliant geneticist but he had clearly lost touch with reality.
My thesis is based on his research.
Yes, you always wanted his approval.
And now you're telling that it was all for nothing?
I'm telling you... to let go.
I need to know why he died.
And then I need to finish what he started.
Yeah, I'm in his place now.
No, no, no, he left everything behind but his computer.
Research, the map.
Yeah, let's get a team in here to bag and tag everything.
I gotta call you right back.
Time to get up, Mika!
Damn, Mika, do n't do that to me.
I'm just working on my computer.
Prologic prog's bad.
So I had to build a new one.
Anyone ever tell you you're the smartest little man on the planet?
You do, all the time.
It's a pinhall camera.
It's for the eclipse.
You ca n't be late.
Mom, I'm already dressed and I've packed my own lunch.
That's what I've been doing this morning.
Do n't get smart with me.
I've been working to pay our bills.
Yeah, that's why they turned down our gas again?
Go grab your stuff and wait by the backdoor, okay?
Mom, what's going on?
- Yeah, almost.
It's like 70, 80 feet.
This is so unreal.
Okay, I'm good.
That was attempt number 6.
You get out here, yes?
I've got a fundraiser and a drinks meeting
Sometimes I'm falling, sometimes I'm flying.
- Sometimes you're in'em.
- I do n't have time for this now.
They are n't just dreams, Nathan.
I thought they'd go away but they're not.
I'm gonna need this back by 6, please.
This morning when I got out of bed, my foot hovered before it touched the ground.
Hovered for a split second like I was floating.
I'm telling you, I think I can fly.
I'll tell you what, you think you can fly, why do n't you just off the Brooklyn Bridge?
Maybe I oughta start with something a little lower first.
It's le leng twalk.
- You're serious?
- Oh, I'm serious.
You need to snap out of it, Peter.
I'm 8 points down in the polls.
This is not about you, all right?
And I have this feeling that you're the only person that's gonna understand.
Why the hell would I understand that you think you can fly?
Because you're my brother.
I'll be there in ten minutes.
- What did she do now?
- She got arrested.
- Arrested for what?
Besides the fact that it was so gross, I almost fudge myself, this is the single coolest thing that happened in this town in like a 100 years.
Why did you want me to tape you?
I have my reasons.
It's not like you're not gonna be popular anymore
who said anything about being popular?
my life as I know it is over, okay?
I've got the Bishop game next week, SATs in October, homecoming is 3 weeks from today and I'm a freak show!
You're being a little dramatic, do n't you think?
No, I do n't think.
I have busted like every bone in my body, stabbed myself in the chest,
I've shoved a two foot steel rod through my neck and I do n't have a scratch on me.
What do you call that thing, sticking out?
Just give me the tape, okay?
I'll talk to you in front of people at school tomorrow.
Your son is a very intelligent boy.
His father is not around and sometimes I think he could use a bit of a tronger hand, you know.
It's not about the work.
The truth is I just do n't know if this school is the right fit for him.
- But he's made friends.
- He's on the soccer team.
I wrote a check for $25,000 to get him into this snob fest.
I was told that's what it took.
That's on top of the tuition.
About the tuition, your last 3 checks have bounced.
Fine, take it out of the 25 grand that I gave you.
That was a donation and it was very appreciated.
Well, I want my money back.
I want my money back now.
That money went to capital campaign for the new wing.
- It's already been spent.
- Then unspend it.
I want my money back.
Let's get out of here.
You're too good for this lousy school.
They dropped the charges.
I had to fill out a form.
I'm running for Congress.
Do you have any idea what this is gonna do to me if it gets out?
With our family's past.
Nevermind, I do n't wanna know.
What are you thinking?
You know, it's been one ridiculous stunt after another with you for the last 6 months.
Just get over it.
Go worry about you, I'll handle this.
Yeah, good, I gotta make sure this stays buried.
Thanks a lot, ma '!
What were you thinking?
I just wanted to feel alive again.
Nathan only cares about himself.
Your father was the same way.
Alpha dogs, both of them.
You, in the meantime, for all your selflessness and sitting with dying people...
You're gonna retire with what you make?
Maybe I'll shoplift my socks.
Do n't get smart.
When you put everyone else first, you end up last.
You always put Nathan first, he took advantage.
It was n't you that was just pushing him right out in front of me?
He takes up more space than you.
And besides it's not my fault, you allowed it.
He's my brother, I love him.
He loves me too.
You've always been close.
That's cruel, mom.
Since dad died I know you've been feeling free to speak your mind but it would n't hurt to edit yourself every once in a while.
I'm sorry if the truth hurts.
I'm just saying you hero worships him.
I ca n't help it.
I never told you this but when Nathan had his accident,
We all got the same call.
No, I'm saying before the call.
Like he was telling me.
I woke up and I knew that he'd been hurt.
I hate it here.
She does n't even have any books to read.
Baby, I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna go and pack up a few things, okay?
We should really go see dad.
- What good would that do?
- He could help.
He should know that someone is trying to hurt us.
Look, I made some mistakes.
- I admit it.
- Mom, what did you do?
I need you to know that I would never let anything happen to you.
Mom, why did you look at yourself like that in the fish tank?
- A couple hours tops.
- I went to see Linderman.
No, it's just bills.
I used the rest to get Mika into private school.
I do n't know what to do with him in public and... it's just I needed them to think that we had money on the mob?
- You were n't born yesterday.
- It's just 2 weeks overdue.
I thought that I could handle it, okay?
- I'm under a lot of stress, okay?
I feel like I'm kinda losing it a little bit.
I'm seeing things.
Like I keep feeling like someone is watching me.
Yeah, Linderman wants his money back so he sent some mouthbreather that's gonna put you in the hospital.
No, it is someone else.
It's someone that I ca n't see.
Does this make any sense to you?
- But I'll tell you what does.
I should n't be telling you this.
No, let me tell you what does make sense.
You need to come up with that 30 grand plus interests now.
Or you gotta run.
Turn on the camera.
- I'm okay.
- You're all right.
- I'm fine.
There's no burns.
Seemed like a good guy.
I thought I was a slob!
They were here too.
I got a guy who can clean this up for a 100 bucks.
We rent by the week.
I'm gonna need to know you can afford it.
- I have a job.
I'll get you an application.
Isaac... what are you doing?
What the hell is wrong with you
What are you, crazy?
I do n't even remember painting these.
I Was high, okay?
- I lied to you.
I've been chasing for a month.
Well, then get yourself back into a program and make it stick this time.
What are you talking out?
Want to know what I'm talking about?
- I painted it three weeks ago
- Yeah. and so?
Look at the number on thhe bus
Something's wrong with me.
Well i'll get you help, isaac.
I've tried that twice and there's only one way left, and you know it.
You ca n't go cold turkey.
- I mean, let me help you, please.
I'll drag you down with me.
I swear i will just leave me alone.
it was n't easy, nathan, but consider it gone.
I know, I owe you big on this one, Tom.
- I'm not gonna forget it.
- I wo n't let you forget it.
It only took half of my political capital to pull her off.
Why ca n't she get herself a hobby?
Like a normal person?
They were married 41 years.
It's a plea for attention.
Give her some time, will you?
I do n't have time.
I've got 8 days to make up 10 points.
I need all the help I can get which is what I want to talk to you about.
I wanna offer you a job.
You're good with people.
I need a coordinator to help organize the volunteers and you got nice guy instincts, I could use that.
I'm a shark, Pete.
It's starting to show up in the polls.
I bring you on, it kinda reflects well on me.
All right, so I'm making you look good?
That's a new one.
Makes me look like I put family first.
I mean I know that sounds self - serving but this is for you too, right?
You gotta think of your future.
How do you do that?
Even try to make it look like this has something to do with me.
You did n't hear anything that I said earlier today, did you?
You mean about how you can fly?
Yeah, I did.
I'm gonna pretend fo both our sakes you did n't say anything like that.
I already have a job.
Yeah, watching old people die, now there's a career.
It's not cute anymore, man.
The dreamy kid sitting in the back of the classroom, staring at the window.
It's time for you to grow up.
Look, I cast a big shadow, Pete.
Life is n't fair.
I'm trying to do the right thing by you here, okay?
I do n't want your pity.
Corner of Center and Canal, please.
Yeah, I wonder if it's gonna be a total.
Not here, no.
In some other part of the world, yes.
Makes one appreciate just how small our planet really is.
May I ask you something, Mohinder?
Do you ever get the feeling like you were meant to do something extraordinary?
I'm driving a cab, you may have noticed.
I'm not talking about what you do, I'm talking about... who you are.
I'm talking about... being special.
Yes, we are all special.
Some individuals, it is true, are more special.
This is natural selection.
It begins as a single individual.
Born or hatched like every other member of their species.
Anonymous, seemingly ordinary.
They carry inside them the genetic code that will take their species to the next evolutionary round.
Hey, I ca n't believe you left like that.
I know, I was there.
You saved that dude's life.
50 grand is a lot of money.
Mr. Linderman wants to be nice about this.
You should have read the fine print.
Look, I have a son.
I'm all he's got.
Please, I can get you the money.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna make you a little business proposition.
40 bucks for every 20 minutes you take off your clothes?
I'm gonna give you a chance to lower your debt a little.
And see where it goes from there.
Show me what you got.
Lift up your shirt, baby.
Ooh, look at that belly.
Is that what you want?
What's the matter, baby?
You just gotta get it good here.
What's the problem, baby?
I said what's the matter?
Hi, this is Nicky.
Leave me a message.
mom, are you there?
When are you coming to get me?
You said you'd be back soon just come and pick me up okay?
- hello - peter, it's me hi, Hey, simone.
- are you busy?
- okay, I'll see you there bye you know, I'll hut here, please.
where to my friend?
Going home to my family.
These business trips are wearing me out.
Your name... on your license there.
That's indian, yes?
There was a professor Suresh in the university of Madras.
Do n't think he's teaching anymore.
But you would n't know anything about that, would you?
Probably a lot of Sureshs where you're from.
Like Smith... or Anderson.
And then Carla had the nerve to tell me he's not breed worthy.
It's just not true, Mr. Mubbles.
That's what he is.
He still humps my leg when I watch TV.
All right, enough about, Mr. Mubbles.
What did everybody else do today?
Doug and I saw this mexican guy.
A homeless dude, on the way to school.
We thought he was dead.
But he was n't.
I thought dad was coming home today.
He finished up early, he's coming home tonight.
Just in time to read my report card.
So what about you Claire?
Do anything special today?
I walked through fire and I did n't get burned.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You're so crazy sometimes.
I think I know exactly what you mean.
Here I am talking dogs again and you go and say something really profound!
We come up against all kinds of fires in our lives and when we test ourselves and face our fears, we usually do n't get burned.
You are very wise, sweetheart.
Whatever it is you did, I'm proud of you.
And so is Mr. Mubbles.
He's just so proud of Claire.
We're proud of Claire.
Yes, we're so proud of Claire, are n't we?
What are you looking for?
I need you to come with me some place.
Look, there's something I need to tell you.
That is gonna have to wait.
I need to stop living for other people.
I promise you we will talk about this later, okay?
All right, now I really need you to come with me.
You're a nurse.
You can give out a shot.
- You can help him.
I thought we could go to the movies.
wanted to tell you that.
No, you think I'm trying to be your best friend again, admit it.
It's all right, we can go to the movies together.
It's no big deal.
I wanna be your mom.
I wanna... give you advice but I do n't wanna push you away.
I want advice, I do.
I wo n't push you away I promise.
About being so popular.
I do n't wanna see you make mistakes like I did.
I wanted to be someone more interesting than I am.
You breed show dogs.
Whose mom does that?
No, I wanted to hitchhike across Europe, study art, fall in love with some... poetry quoting french man.
You should know who you are and know that it's enough.
Cause who you are is special.
About that. There's something I need to say.
Something I never talked about 'cause I thought it would upset you and dad.
Sweetheart, you can say anything to us, you know that.
I think I'm old enough for you to tell me who my real parents are.
- I'm glad you're home.
- Oh, me too.
I've such a headache.
I slammed my head getting out of a taxi cab.
I'm just saying it's impossible, okay?
- Nobody can predict the future.
- I saw it with my own eyes, Peter.
I brought someone here to help.
He's a nurse.
God, he's overdosed.
Yeah, I'm at 215 Reed Street.
I need an ambulance here immediately.
he's OD no, no, he's conscious
Okay, baby, it's okay.
they're sending an ambulance right away, okay?
you just hang in there, okay?
You're gonna be okay, I swear.
We have to stop it.
This quest, this need to solve life's mysteries.
In the end what does it matter when the human heart can only find a meaning the smallest of moments.
In the shadows, in the light.
Do they even know yet?
All right, I'm here.
Now what do you want?
I've been up here all night.
Thinking about my destiny.
What you doing, Pete?
It's my turn to be somebody now, Nathan.
In ancient times, people believed the heavens were filled with gods and monsters and magical worlds.
Then, as time passed, those beliefs faded into myth and folklore.
But now we know the stories were true.
Other worlds, with names like Asgard, do exist.
And beings once revered as gods, like Thor, have returned, leaving us with more questions and... an enormous mess to clean up.
Do n't say I never gave you anything.
Checking for alien spectrographic signatures
- one teeny rock at a time.
We do n't want anything alien getting in the wrong hands.
- a monkey could easily do.
- You're our little monkey.
Do n't give me that look.
I'll talk to them when I talk to them.
- Talk to who?
They want explanations and answers for... well, all this.
But I do n't have any answers.
And, more importantly, I have n't talked to them since I was ill.
So, Asgardians are aliens from another planet that visited us thousands of years ago?
And because we could n't understand aliens, we thought they were gods?
Do you think other deities are aliens, too?
Vishnu for sure, right?
You know, it'd be nice if, for once, Thor and his people sent down the god of cleaning up after yourself.
They probably have a magic broom for this kind of thing.
I just wish they'd left their alien ship behind.
So we can clean that up, too?
So we could go inside, take a peek under the hood, maybe take it for a spin.
Come on, you're telling me piloting an alien ship
I ca n't think of a single time when anything alien in human hands ended well.
Would n't mind getting my human hands on Thor.
He's so dreamy.
- Definitely not from here.
Another piece of the ship.
Out of sight out of mind.
That's why we're here.
- Now, who would do something like that?
"South of the water, North of the hill..."
- "... a halo of stones..." - "protect the tree still."
Jakob, is this it? We should check that out.
Finally, after all this time.
I ca n't wait to tell the others.
and that I would find it.
Are you ready? What you're feeling, do n't fight it.
That rage, it's already inside of you.
Do n't hide from its power.
Embrace it! God!
What have you done?
I can climb it if you want.
Just talk me through what to do with the... doodads.
- Yeah, it's only about 15 feet.
- I'll be fine.
I'm just a bit more wary about the height thing since falling to certain death.
But some feelings will take over if you dwell on them.
Now, keep your eyes ahead.
Focus on what you like to do best.
You like to figure things out.
- I'm curious.
Whatever was up in these trees had to be there for centuries, right?
At least a millennium.
Radiocarbon - 14 dates some of these trees at 9,000 years old.
Think the tree grew around it?
I'll catch you if you fall.
Screaming, and so much hate in her eyes.
And you said she had a silver stick?
Could you describe or draw them?
I I just ran.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Fitz, you getting this?
This is n't another viral threat.
Spectrographic signatures match readings from... Thor's hammer.
Simmons, whatever was in that tree is Asgardian.
I - I can see an imprint of what was embedded.
Scanning for three - dimensional restoration.
I'll convert it, print a 3 - D model.
This forest is a protected reserve.
Anything that might help us to find these people or where they might be hiding?
Sir, does n't look like they're hiding.
Sending to your devices now.
Reports indicate that the group of about a dozen was led by this man and woman, and though their motive was unclear, their message was hauntingly spelled out on the streets of Oslo.
Well, I guess we know who they think they are.
Jakob Nystrom, 30.
Girlfriend, Petra Larsen.
Leaders of a Norse Paganist hate group.
And their numbers are growing, thanks to what happened in Greenwich and thanks to the internet.
Yay, internet, she said sarcastically.
Obsessed with anything derived from Norse mythology...
- stories of Asgard.
- And now a weapon.
The scan only accounted for one side.
Too much damage to the tree for complete reproduction.
But see here... it's clearly broken on both ends.
- So there are more pieces?
Which means Sid and Nancy may be looking for a complete set.
- The Asgardian symbolism.
Hard to translate with our limited knowledge.
You should give your buddy the god of thunder a shout.
He gets his power from his hammer, right?
What if this is his nail to the hammer?
And if he has a cellphone, we do n't have the number.
S.H.I.E.L.D. 's investigations are on the trail of Nystrom and his followers.
We're charged with identifying the object and finding any other pieces before they do.
They seem to have some advantage.
They found this thing in 150 square kilometers of Norwegian forest.
What if it called to them with magic?
We know it's Asgardian, so the rules are a little bendy here.
Just because we do n't understand something yet does n't mean we should regress back to the dark ages, talking of magic and fairy tales.
Actually, that's exactly what we're going to do.
When we first found the hammer in New Mexico, I consulted one of the world's leading experts on Norse mythology...
Elliot Randolph, a Professor at a university in Seville.
We'll leave immediately.
Maybe he can tell us more about these markings.
Recent events have thrown us all for a loop.
I thought I was teaching Norse mythology.
So, you're not going to change my grade?
No. I will give you a week to rewrite it.
I think, in general, little more history, less lit crit.
But I do hope we're still on for dinner tonight.
I've included a list of books there that might help you.
I'll see you later.
I did n't know you were a collector.
On a government salary, not quite.
Well, I'm assuming you found something on the ground in London.
In a tree in Norway.
And, unfortunately, we were n't the ones who found it.
I'd say I'm looking at a piece of the Berserker staff.
Yeah, the myth dates back to the late 12th century.
It's all about a powerful warrior from Asgard.
A soldier in the Berserker army.
Fierce army it was.
Berserkers battled like raging beasts, destroying everything in their path.
A single Berserker had the strength of 20 warriors.
So whoever wielded the staff got superhuman strength?
Fighting with it put the warrior into a state of uncontrollable rage.
The staff contained a very powerful magic.
Analytically minded and pretty as a peach.
- The warrior in the story?
- Well, in the story, he came to Earth to fight, but he ended up falling in love.
- With life on Earth.
He fell so much in love that when his army returned to Asgard, he stayed behind.
What happened to the staff?
Well, he did n't want its dark magic falling into the wrong hands, so he broke it into three pieces and hid each one in a different location.
Now, let's all bear in mind these are poetic abstracts from long - lost ancient texts.
So, there is one about a tree, which they've found, it seems.
Another is, "East of the river, sun overhead, buried in Earth with the bones of the dead."
There's another here.
Well, this one does n't even have a rhyme.
It could also mean nothing.
I was hoping for less metaphor, more longitude and latitude.
Well, I mean, it does stand to reason to search near Viking raid routes, does n't it?
Now, there have been some recent interesting findings of Norse relics on Baffin island off the coast of Canada.
Yeah, virtual treasure trove of new artifacts.
We'll start there, then.
Did you know there's mount Thor on Baffin island?
- Do you know what's not on mount Thor?
Anything Asgardian at all.
Our agents on the ground have n't found a thing.
Nystrom's deep - web message boards are just abuzz with psychos.
They believe they're gonna ascend to be the gods of destruction and death.
That's your progress?
"People suck"?
And there's also chatter about going underground.
Randolph said to check Viking routes.
There's some sites along the Volga river in Russia,
- some in Kiev, and weirdly, here.
- In Seville, Spain?
It's a long shot, but Vikings sacked Seville twice.
We found one promising location with Viking relics...
A church built on the ruins of an 8 th - century crypt
- built on Roman ruins from 206 B.C.
- East of a river.
And lots of bones.
Let's see what we can dig up.
See what I did there?
have a mandatory nap time.
Siesta is n't mandatory.
How you doing, Agent Ward?
Wishing I was shorter.
All my readings are normal.
What about you, Skye?
I'm lucky my S.O. volunteered to take the super - creepy hallway instead of the slightly less - creepy dungeon - room place.
Ward, your spectrograph is reading something near you.
- I do n't see anything.
- Well, it's right in front of you.
It's moving. Northwest.
- Okay Ward, turn left.
I have a wonderful explanation.
- Ward, what's happening?
- His device just went down.
- Already on it.
Something's wrong with Ward.
The staff's gone.
I have one, too.
He ca n't just disappear.
A block South of the church.
- I screwed up.
Ward, you passed out.
And you were acting not right.
Um, before you lost consciousness, were you feeling claustrophobic?
- I do n't panic. Ever.
- Touching the staff caused it, right?
Are you exhibiting any extra s-strength?
Why do n't I find out on that guy?
- We need to find the staff.
- What exactly do you remember?
Something I had n't thought about in a long time.
- Why do n't we leave it alone?
I want to hear this. One of my men is hurt.
The staff is gone.
- I did n't want any of that to happen.
- What did you want?
- The staff's power for yourself?
You know, I just wanted to be the first to study it, to prove that the Berserkers were actually here, a part of history.
- You think about that.
Your heart rate's rising.
You need to calm down, not get worked up.
The memory... was it about your brother?
Do n't you ever get tired of hearing your own voice?
- Ward, stop.
Ward, what you're experiencing, this feeling...
- it's chemistry.
Yeah, spikes in his adrenocorticotropic hormone.
It's like those stories you hear when a mother is able to lift a car to save her baby.
We can relieve some of the symptoms.
Look how you're behaving.
And if I'm sedated and we cross paths with those juiced freaks, the ones who flip cars and smash people up, are you gonna take them on?
Or am I gonna have to save Simmons' ass... again?
That was just a biochemical reaction.
He did n't mean all that.
- No, I know.
- No explanation necessary.
- How'd they find it?
They may have the original texts.
I was n't involved.
You know, it was just a chance to uncover something that the gods brought down from the heavens.
Did n't work out too well.
So cases like this are personal to me.
That's all I know.
You should be more careful.
- I'm working it out.
You're punching things.
The last thing you need is to punch things.
- You got a better idea?
- Let me help you.
The only help I need is to stop those guys before they hurt somebody else.
We are the new order!
Our world is being taken by gods!
We will become gods and take it back!
This is the new order!
Are you ready to take back the power?
- A moment, sir?
I'm concerned that my exposure to that weapon has compromised my ability to do my job.
- You're familiar with my family history.
So, for obvious reasons, I do n't think back to childhood.
There are things I put away a long time ago.
Because to do this, I have to be focused, tactical.
I ca n't be distracted.
Especially by things that happened a lifetime ago.
You're saying touching the staff unlocked certain memories.
And it wo n't go away.
I do n't trust myself.
Grant... you telling me this makes me feel I can trust you.
You've got some rage built up.
Maybe it's time to let it out.
You need to start talking.
I told Agent Coulson everything I know.
Tell me what that thing did to me and how fix it.
I swear I do n't know.
Otherwise, that would have been awfully embarrassing.
Okay, I have to know.
- How did you figure me out?
You guys do n't flinch or panic in captivity.
Two... a Waterfield 44?
On a lit Professor's salary?
Well, you're certainly more observant than most, Agent Coulson.
So, you're the Asgardian warrior who stayed.
Please do n't tell anyone.
I had no clue.
Hidden in plain sight... an actual Asgardian.
How long do you suppose he's been on our planet?
If we could just cut him open a little bit, get some tissue samples, maybe some bodily fluids,
- we could find out.
- Or we could just ask him, weirdo.
Sealing the interrogation - room door.
Ah, locking me in.
Well, I've been in tighter spots.
This room is made of a silicon carbide - coated Vibranium alloy.
Meant for prisoners like yourself.
But you're in here, too.
And eventually, somebody will open that door.
So, the myth is your autobiography.
I did n't write it.
I did n't want anyone to know about me.
Then I had to open my big mouth.
I met a French girl in 1546.
Ah, she loved stories.
So... I told her a great one, all about the peaceful Asgardian warrior who stayed.
Now, how was I to know her brother the priest would write it all down and turn it into, I do n't know, a thing?
Do you know Thor?
Oh, sure, I spent all my days palling around with the future King of Asgard.
No, I do n't know Thor.
I was a mason.
For thousands of years.
If you can imagine that.
So when they came, asking for people to fight, yes, of course I signed up.
I think, really, I just wanted to travel.
- But you had the staff.
- I hated that thing.
Other guys loved all the power that comes with the rage.
- And you do n't, either, it seems.
- What did it do to me?
It shines a light into your dark places.
Does n't matter if you're human, Asgardian.
"Shines a light." That's no explanation.
It was forged from a rare metal and reacts to whoever is holding it.
I went to such great lengths to make sure that the staff was n't found.
Unfortunately, since the myth was written down, people have been searching for it for centuries.
I need your help to stop them before they get the last piece of your staff.
Oh, I am a pacifist now.
And you do n't want to risk your identity being discovered.
Listen, I would n't worry too much about these angry youths.
They always calm down, and eventually, they die of old age.
And that is one of the pleasant aspects of life here.
You may not know Thor.
My first love on this planet was Ireland.
There was a monastery, and the monks gave me a nice, warm place to sleep, some soup,
- and some mulled wine.
- "Near god."
The effects of the staff... are they permanent?
The strength wears off.
You will feel exhausted afterwards.
You'll need sleep.
It's worse on humans.
Are you sure Ward's okay to go into the field? He's not exactly acting like himself.
But he knows it.
He'll be fine.
I'm with Coulson.
They venerated me a bit as a saint.
- Where's the staff?
- It's upstairs.
Is that the normal Ward or the new, angrier Ward?
Why do you think I trusted them with my secret?
They take a vow of silence.
If you want to defeat a god, you must become one.
We need to help him!
I'll get her.
- How is he?
- I do n't know what to do.
We know, but she does n't understand his anatomy.
- What in god's name?
- Sometimes, you have to just jump in and figure things out.
Now, Asgardians regenerate faster than we do.
Maybe we can keep him alive long enough...
- For his body to heal itself.
- Okay, what am I looking for?
I think I got it.
Can you feel a tear or rupture?
Clamp down hard on his heart.
- Grant, drop the staff.
- This is n't you.
Help me! Please!
Please, help me! Grant!
- Not yet, Grant.
Throw him the rope, and I'll throw you in there, too.
Grant! Oh, my god.
This time, let me help.
I am not afraid of you.
You are easily the most beautiful thing I've seen in a thousand years.
He just shoved his hand inside?
I froze, did n't know what to do.
Hey, you did n't freeze.
- Maybe I should jump in.
Yeah, it's great to hear your voice, too.
It's been a difficult few weeks.
When you held it, did you see anything?
- How did you hold all three?
- Because I see it every day.
I know that look.
Now, what is it you want to see?
You and I have a lot in common.
We've both been stabbed in the heart.
I'm hazy on that.
I have no memory of being revived, of being in a hospital.
Just... woke up a few months later.
And are you haunted by it, Mr. Coulson?
Then what's the problem?
I suppose you're right.
Well, you know, with Europe's new fascination with all things Asgardian, I'm wondering if it's time to start over somewhere else.
Life of tropical drinks and massages?
Mm, oh, I'd get bored.
You should consider the American Northwest.
Well, if you will come and visit.
It's not everyone I get to share my stories with.
And if Thor's in town, I'll introduce you.
I could get used to turndown service and little mints on my pillow.
We deserve a nice night.
- How you feeling?
I'm not that guy.
When you're a guy who saves lives, I can overlook a little Hulk rage.
No harm, no foul.
Does everything just roll off your back?
No. If it helped, I'd rage all the time, but it does n't.
What I saw... it was about my brother.
My shoulder's free.
Another time, maybe.
- Did I fall asleep?
- For a little while.
It means you are relaxed.
Honestly, Tahiti's too good to be true.
It's a magical place.
Burn them. Burn them all!
Burn them all! -
The dead do n't rest.
It's so green.
Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over.
Maple, elm, beech, poplar.
And of course now that summer's over, you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in.
Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else.
You're a nervous talker.
That's not any better being a nervous mute.
I did n't think I'd ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I did n't.
A person just does n't feel welcome at that point.
And I certainly did n't expect to be introducing him to my family.
That Little Sam is your baby.
Yes, now that's very important.
If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in.
He'll get an education.
He'll learn to read.
And you can help teach him.
What did you tell your family about me?
I told them I met you in the North.
Well, it was n't a very large piece of parchment.
You did n't tell them where I'm really from?
You did n't tell them I'm a wildling?
He hoped I'd make a man of myself by "killing some bloody wildlings,"
so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.
I think we're here.
I never thought I'd see you again.
Gods, you're a woman now.
Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway.
- He has yellow teeth --
- That's enough, Talla.
I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.
Oh, and this, this is our son Samwell.
It's me, your grandmother.
May I hold him?
Yes, of course.
You'll be a scholar like your father.
They're on a hunt.
They'll join us for dinner.
You must be exhausted.
Come, you'll be wanting a bath after all that travel.
Oh, and a dress for dinner.
You can wear one of mine.
What's your color?
Midnight blue or silver?
Silver, maybe. Come.
You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want.
Is there no other way?
You're afraid for her?
Of course I'm afraid for her!
It just seems very dangerous.
She'll be protected the entire way.
The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds.
And Queen Margaery is n't your mother.
I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf.
She's truly opened her heart to them.
She's always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
And now she's devoted to the gods as well.
Would you like to see her?
Have they hurt you?
Have they mistreated you?
- No, Your Grace.
- I've missed you.
More than you could know.
We'll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.
He says there's no other way.
He's not quite what we thought he was, is he?
You think I'm mad.
You could never.
You're right, he's not.
He's a lot more --
There's something about him.
His way of looking at the world.
It's not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are.
It's taken me a while.
He's helped me.
What are you talking about?
You're a good person.
You've always been a good person.
- You're the best person I know.
I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it.
I never gave them what they really needed, though.
I've had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good.
All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did.
There were so many lies in those stories.
It's such a relief to let go of those lies.
I love my brother.
I will always love my brother.
His soul is pure and perfect.
His sins do n't erase that purity, they only obscure it.
He just needs to atone for them.
Sooner or later, one way or another.
The gods have a plan for us all.
It's hard to walk in this.
This venison, it's very tasty.
We have n't been able to cure that one yet.
This is last week's.
- Brought it down from 70 yards.
So do you do much hunting up at the Wall?
Oh, yes. Yes.
North of the Wall, you do n't hunt, you do n't eat.
Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
Oh, and Gilly.
I imagine it's common where you're from.
We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, was n't it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt.
Your father taught you to hunt?
Our father would never teach us.
I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
That's enough of that.
Samwell, would you care for more bread?
I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander.
- He wants me to --
- I read your letter.
You're to be a maester.
And once I have my chain, I'll return to Castle Black.
I thought the Night's Watch might make a man of you.
Your nose buried in books.
Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men.
I'll wager you still ca n't sit a horse or wield a sword.
Randyll, to be master of the Night's Watch is a great honor.
He can wield a sword.
He killed a Thenn.
He killed a white walker.
There's no such thing.
I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black.
He drove a dagger into the walker's heart.
He risked his own life to save mine more than once.
He's a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
Your way down to Castle Black?
Where did he kill a white walker?
How'd you come to meet my son?
The Night's Watch came to our keep.
- North of the Wall?
The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son.
It's called Heartsbane.
It's been in our family for 500 years.
It's Valyrian steel.
Only a handful of them left in the world.
It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die.
If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house.
Who else would have him?
This you getting back at me, boy?
Bringing that to my table and making me dine with it?
And you got what you were after, did n't you?
Your invitation into our home.
I've lost my appetite.
Your mother's a fine woman.
You're not worthy of her.
To please her, I'll take the wildling in.
She can work in the kitchens.
But this will be the last night you ever spend at Horn Hill.
I'm sorry I let him treat you that way.
I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.
I'm not angry at you.
I'm angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it.
When do you have to go?
You're not what he thinks you are, Sam.
He does n't know what you are.
- We're leaving.
- Get your things.
I do n't have any things.
- We belong together.
What about your mother and sister?
Oh, they'll understand.
Your sister's dress.
She wo n't mind.
Looks better on you anyway.
That's your father's sword.
It's my family's sword.
He can bloody well try.
The lion and the rose are one.
I thank the gods above.
And to you, my beauteous bride, I pledge undying love.
I'll drink a toast to my new queen, for there is no one fairer.
Dear Uncle, will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer?
Drink long and deep, my noble king, from this cup of sweet wine.
The last drink he shall ever take.
And vengeance shall be mine.
- -... that poisoned me.
My golden lion foully, falsely slain.
I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain.
Hear my prayer, O cruel gods.
For I can not face another day when my sweet boy is dead.
Oh, darkest day, my heart is full of sorrow.
All joy is gone.
And there is no tomorrow.
What is that I hear and smell?
Someone I'll soon send to hell.
You killed my wife and now you've taken your father's life.
Curse the day I named you.
Now I must flee.
Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery.
Do n't fear winter.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Bianca,
Give this a good beating.
What are you doing back here?
I saw you the other day in the audience.
How many times have you seen this stupid play?
I remember when the players came to my village. I did n't have any money, so I snuck in.
Saw the painted faces, the costumes, listened to the songs, cried when the young lovers died in each other's arms.
I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.
You're very good.
But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing's no good.
It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.
How would you change it?
The queen loves her son more than anything.
And he was taken from her before she could say good - bye.
She would n't just cry.
She would be angry.
She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.
Do you like pretending to be other people?
My father's waiting for me.
Lady Crane, they loved you.
No laugh for Ned's death.
These people are worse than animals.
But they loved her.
They all love her.
Yes, you are adored by people and animals alike.
I do what I can with what I'm given.
Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?
Full to the tits with ideas.
- I did n't mean --
- You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas.
Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I've been doing this my whole life?
Who is anyone to judge my work?
This is my profession.
You have no right to an opinion.
Careful of that one.
She wants you dead.
A girl had many gifts.
Do n't let her suffer.
My friends, the hour has come.
Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children.
But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came.
Madness has had its day!
Rich or poor, noble or common, if we sin, we must atone.
Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner.
She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied.
She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins.
She disgraced her house, her king, and herself.
We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell.
Give them to us and we'll be on our way.
I do n't have the authority to give them to you.
The gods do n't recognize his authority in this matter.
You've already insulted one great house.
It wo n't happen twice.
Every last sparrow will die before Margaery Tyrell walks down that street.
To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us.
We yearn for it.
But there is no call for it today.
Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven.
A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith.
Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory.
He's beaten us.
That's what's happening.
When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown.
Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born.
You do n't have to do this.
You do n't have to do anything.
I have to answer to the gods.
Not when you're sitting in that chair.
The Crown's decision on this matter is final.
Will I be walking naked in the streets?
Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy?
You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years.
And you will continue to do so.
But not in this city.
You've lost it?
It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.
Presumably you still know where it is.
You did n't lose Riverrun.
You let the Blackfish take it from you.
He knows the castle better than anyone.
You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding.
You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave.
Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you could n't find him.
That's what it means to lose something.
Now he's come back and taken Riverrun.
For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners.
We do n't have the men.
We've got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish.
The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us, raiding our supply trains and camps.
Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year.
If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge.
They're laughing at us.
All across the Riverlands right down to King's Landing, they're laughing at us.
I hear it in my sleep!
I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you.
And I'll not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter.
Take that castle back.
He'll never yield, Father.
And you'll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place.
Cheer up, Lord Edmure.
You're going home.
I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish.
Apparently Walder Frey ca n't manage it on his own because he's 400 years old.
Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.
Better you're elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.
I'm not going to the Riverlands.
I'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows.
I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head and every other sparrow head I can find.
- He has our son!
He's torn our family apart.
How should we treat people who tear us apart?
We should treat them without mercy and we will.
But if you kill the High Sparrow, you wo n't leave the sept alive.
And without you, this is all for nothing.
Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you.
Show them what Lannisters are, what we do to our enemies.
And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can.
You'll stand trial soon.
I need to be here for you.
It will be a trial by combat.
They've made us both stronger, all of them.
They have no idea how strong we are.
No idea what we're going to do to them.
We've always been together.
We'll always be together.
We're the only two people in the world.
Why did you help us?
Now he lives again.
When I last saw you, you were a boy.
Loved to climb the castle walls, frighten his mother.
The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall.
I led a ranging party deep into the North to find white walkers.
A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice.
Left me there to die.
The Children found me.
Stopped the walker's magic from taking hold.
The same way they made the walkers in the first place.
You saw it yourself.
A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart.
I did n't have time to learn.
I ca n't control anything.
You must learn to control it before the Night King comes.
One way or another, he will find his way to the world of men.
When he does, you will be there waiting for him.
And you will be ready.
How many days' ride to Meereen?
A week at best.
How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
- And who has that many?
So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros.
I take what is mine.
You were n't made to sit on a chair in a palace.
What was I made for?
You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.
- Because I do n't want you to touch me there.
Because I said so.
Just let me put my hand there.
I wo n't even move it.
- I swear to God.
I thought you said you were n't gonna do that.
I thought you promised.
Because I do n't want you to.
What is wrong with my just keeping my hand there and not moving it?
But you do n't just keep your hand there without moving it.
- I will this time.
- You promised last time.
- Do n't do what?
- You know damn well what.
No, I do n't.
I am doing nothing.
Well, then stop doing nothing.
Boy, your sister Joyce sure is sexy.
Yeah, but she looked even better before she bleached her hair.
I still think she's sexy.
I still say she's a creep.
It's my house, you know?
It's my party.
Boy, that Miss Phipps sure takes her chaperone real seriously.
She's a bigger drag at parties than she even is at school.
- But she's still the sexiest teacher at school.
- Yeah, and the most uptight.
At least they're not enjoying it.
- What's going on here?
Joyce, she's taking off all her clothes.
Oh, hi, Miss Phipps.
- Philly, what are you doing?
Philly... were you peeking at a girl in the bathroom?
No, I was exercising.
I know it's normal for a boy your age to be curious
Philly, the thing is to find girls whose age is more appropriate for you.
Let's go back to the party and find someone for you to dance with.
And we were supposed to go on a fishing trip to Canada this week.
- How come you did n't?
Now I have to wait three lousy weeks.
- You would n't have had much fun anyway.
- Aw, sure I would.
- What about lunch?
At what time would you like to have your dinner then?
- About 7:00 I guess.
- Wo n't that be too late?
Whatever you say, sir.
- That's your new housekeeper, Miss Mallow?
How old do you think she is?
I do n't know. 25 or 30.
Old, but not as old as the rest we've had.
- Think she puts out?
- Oh, morning, Mr. Green.
- Think she'll do it for the gardener?
Think she'll do it for the chauffer?
Nobody would do it for him.
- I think I'd better walk you to the gate.
Think she'd do it for you?
Well, if you strike out with her, just remember to send her over to me, okay?
What are you, crazy?
You would n't even get up to bat.
Yeah, that's what you think.
Green, please stay away from the car.
I just washed it.
Do you see what you've done here?
- Is that all that you have to say to me?
Ca n't you children find someplace else to play?
Go find someplace else yourself.
We were here first.
Boy, what a creep she is.
I should have gone to camp this summer just to get away from her.
- How come you did n't?
Cause I gotta go on this goddamn cruise with my parents and my creepy sister to goddamn Honolulu.
We're gonna learn the goddamn hula - hula.
Sherman, would you boys like something to eat?
- Guess how old she is.
I wonder what she looks like.
What do you mean "what she looks like"?
I mean under her uniform.
No, my housekeeper.
You take care of everything while I'm away, Philly.
You're the man of the house now, you know.
Philly, I wish your mother were alive so she could see how well you can handle yourself now.
Well, anyway, you listen to Lester and show the new housekeeper the ropes.
You think you can handle her?
Lester, for God sakes, do n't treat my luggage like that.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Fillmore.
There are some important things in there.
Yes, I am relentlessly aware of that, sir.
So, I guess there's nothing else.
Do n't do anything I would n't do.
What are we stopping here for?
I mean, is n't this the servant's entrance?
Do n't you usually drop me off in front of the house?
Will you be getting out here then, Philly?
Do you mind if we talk?
Like what do you do with your time?
Not too much, I guess.
What is there for me to do in this area on my nights off?
There's a movie theater downtown, a drugstore and a couple of bars, I guess.
Not too much really.
What did the other girls do on their nights off?
I mean the other housekeepers.
The other housekeepers are n't exactly what you'd call girls.
They were mostly elderly women.
Their nights off, they mostly went to sleep.
You mean your previous housekeepers have been elderly women mostly?
That must not have been too interesting for you.
I mean it must not have been too interesting for a young man of 15, is it?
I'm not sure I got your point.
It must not have been so interesting to sit across from your elderly housekeepers and look up their dresses like you're looking up mine right now.
Why do you say things like that?
Well, why should n't I?
Because they embarrass me, that's why.
Philly, I was only teasing you.
Did you have a good time?
Hey, I did not want to embarrass you.
- Will you forgive me?
I planned to do some shopping this afternoon.
Can you drop me at the store?
Well, Miss Mallow, I suppose.
I do have an appointment at 10:00.
I ca n't be late, but sure.
But can I change out of my uniform first?
Just do n't be all day about it.
Thank you for waiting, Lester.
Well, Nicole, how is everything going?
Just fine, Lester.
You seem to be getting along with Philly very well.
So when are you gonna get it on with him?
Now listen, sweet pants, Mr. Fillmore's trip is a short one and this whole thing has to be over and done with by the time he gets back.
But, Lester, he's just a 15 - year - old boy.
15 is the perfect age.
Just think, you're giving him private lessons -- an advanced education.
I just feel bad about it.
If you do n't do it, you're gonna feel a lot worse.
Is this a threat, Lester?
Philly, do n't leave it there.
I said do n't leave your bike there.
- It might get run over, disfigured, mangled beyond recognition.
I'm coming up.
- Give me the camera.
Now, on three.
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- My stomach helped me.
- She's unbuttoning her uniform!
- She's doing it!
What'll it be now?
I'm afraid to look.
Aw, damn it!
What a wasted night!
I hope you have n't been upsetting her.
I hope you have n't been upsetting her.
She should n't be upset.
She had a mild attack on her last job.
That's why she had to leave.
You're kidding me.
You mean she did n't tell you?
I thought you two told each other everything.
What's the matter with you today, Philly?
You've hardly said a word to me all day.
Are you mad at me for teasing you for looking up my dress?
Well, then what is it?
Are you too tired to talk to me?
Hard day on the old bike, huh?
Yes, well, big deal.
If you want to watch me undress so badly, why do n't you tell me?
I said if you want to watch me undress so badly, you should have told me.
Well, do you want to watch me undress?
- Go and close the door.
I'm not sure I got you right.
Did you want me in or out?
Well, do you want to watch me undress?
- Well, in then.
You still with me, Philly?
- Do you still want me to continue?
What do you think of them?
My breasts, how do you like them?
Would you like to touch them?
But you still want me to continue though.
I think I'd better go now.
Oh, so soon?
You wo n't stay?
No. I'm sorry.
Oh, what a pity.
- And thank you.
I really enjoyed it.
We should do this again sometime.
Oh, Philly, it's you.
Sherman, it's for you!
- Is n't it a little late for visitors?
- We're making milkshakes in the kitchen.
You'll never guess what just happened to me.
- You wanna guess?
Oh, you boys have business you wanna discuss?
Get out of here, you creep.
- So, what's up?
Well, about ten minutes ago,
I'm walking past Miss Mallow's bedroom, and she stops me in the hall and asks me if I wanna come inside.
So I say "sure" and I go inside.
Then she asks me if I wanna watch her strip naked.
So I say "sure" and so she does.
She takes off all her clothes.
What do you mean "so then what?"
So then I came here to tell you.
Are you kidding me?
Hey, why do you think I'm kidding you?
I suppose you screw your housekeeper every goddamn night!
Oh, you and old Florence make a great couple.
Are you embarrassed about last night?
Are you sure you're not embarrassed about seeing me naked last night?
Why do you ask?
Why do n't you come and visit me tonight after I've finished with the dishes?
Sherm, Philly, I want you boys to work on your backhand today.
I do n't want you peeking in the girls locker room anymore either, huh?
Go out and get'em.
Boy, that guy is weird!
Yeah, him and Lester would make a great couple.
He could have gotten us thrown out of the club.
For just copping a peek at the girls?
If we could have got thrown out for that, what you did with Mallow could have gotten you arrested.
Shut up and play tennis, huh?
Oh, I do n't know!
Oh, Sherman, pick up the balls.
I mean, you're very impatient.
Hey, Philly, were old Mallow's knockers this big?
- You know that's not fair.
How come you did n't touch'em?
I did n't know how.
You just grab'em like this and squeeze.
How the hell would you know?
When was the last time you saw a knocker?
Hey, Philly, Sue Ellen Turner will let you look at hers for a dollar.
How come you did n't touch'em?
Huh, big boy?
Well, she's gotta be in the mood.
Besides, I'm a leg man.
You know you're crazy.
Yeah, come on.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Travis.
Be sure and tell me about tonight, lover boy.
I looked for you in your room and you were n't there.
You said you wanted to talk to me?
Come in, Philly.
What are you doing in my father's bathtub?
- No, I guess not.
Would you like to wash my back?
Would you like to join me?
Would I like to what?
Take a bath with me?
You mean in there with you right now?
Why do n't you try it?
Maybe you'll like it.
Well, I probably would n't even fit in there.
Oh, yes you would.
You mean you want me to take off all my clothes and everything?
Do you usually wear them when you take a bath?
Oh, come on, Philly.
I wo n't even look.
Oh, come on.
It will be an adventure.
Hey, where are you going?
Do n't you want to take your robe off and join me?
Okay, just a sec.
Wo n't you take them off?
Well, all right then.
Come in the bath with your bathing trunks.
I'll wash your shoulder.
Well, how does that feel?
Are you sure you do n't want to take them off?
Okay, under one condition.
- Can I help you?
I think I'd better go now.
Philly, wait a second.
- Wait a second, will you?
Will you forgive me?
Hey, prove it.
By sleeping with me tonight.
Well, I tried it once before in summer camp and I know for a fact that you ca n't get a good night's sleep when someone else is in the same bunk with you.
Well, thank you.
It's been a lovely evening.
Just to show that there's no hard feelings, would you kiss me good night?
Is it all right if I kiss you good night?
Who the heck takes baths with other people?
Except for the Japanese I mean.
Have you heard of any?
Nobody except the Japanese.
- Did you touch'em?
Her knockers, did you touch them?
- Well, sort of.
Did you or did n't you?
Well, not with my hands.
Does n't that get broads hot, touching their knockers, even with your elbows?
Aw, to hell with this.
Nice girls let you touch their knockers if they like you or if they're going steady with you.
- Hey, Philly, you wanna know what I think?
- Lots of people take baths with other people.
Maybe she's part Japanese?
Hey, Philly, wanna know what else I think?
- I think you're falling for her.
- You're crazy.
Do you think that if a guy touches a woman's knockers -- not on a date, but in his own house -- think it would still count as getting to second base?
With his hands or with his elbows?
- No, I think it has to be on a real date.
Do n't do anything I would n't do.
Oh, excuse me, I'm --
Oh, hi, Joyce.
Do n't you think she's one of the most fantastic creatures?
- I like you better.
- You'll make me blush.
- Hello, son.
Oh, hi, Dad.
- How you doing, Philly?
Well, it's going pretty good here too, and I've got a lot to tell you when I get back.
The bike's just fine.
- Oh, that's good.
And Miss Mallow, is she working out okay too?
Miss Mallow's working out fine too.
Put her on, will you?
- You want to talk to her?
She's not here right now.
She's in the john.
What's so funny?
Oh, nothing, Dad.
Well, Philly, look.
I've got a lot of work to do before tomorrow's meeting.
Say good night to Miss Mallow for me, will you?
Okay, I'll say good night to Miss Mallow for you, Dad.
- And you take care now, huh?
- Okay, son.
Are we going to... you know?
Well, I do n't really know how.
Well, I might be able to show you.
I'd just like to say one thing before we start.
- That I respect you.
I'd also say that I'm prepared to marry you... whenever you say.
Oh, you do n't have to say that.
No, I'm not just saying that.
I'm not just handing you a line or anything.
I wanna marry you.
Oh, Philly, listen to me.
A man and a woman should only get married when they want to raise a family together or they want to live together.
A man and a woman should only get married when they love each other.
But I do love you.
Do n't you love me?
- But you do n't want to marry me.
- I did n't say that.
You did n't say that, but that's what you were thinking, is n't it?
Some silly - ass little kid has just told you that he loves you and wants to marry you.
It's probably all you can do to keep from laughing out loud.
- Philly, you're wrong.
I should have kept my big mouth shut.
You asked her to marry you?
I should have played it cool, strung her along a while.
That's the way you have to treat women.
So tell me, did you get to second base?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Was it fun?
- But why'd you have to ask her to marry you?
I just wanted to apologize for the way I've been acting.
Guess I've been acting very juvenile lately, and I'm sorry.
Well, I guess we might just go steady for a while.
I love that dress you're wearing.
Well, where do you plan to take me tonight?
I have this little place that I know.
I think you'll enjoy it.
Oh, Lester seems to be in a good mood.
Thank you for the corsage.
Oh, glad you like it.
And the Chateaubriand for two.
And I think I'll have a glass of white wine to go with it.
Madame is perhaps mistaken.
With the red meat we have the red wine.
The lady prefers the white wine.
I'd like you to bring her what she prefers.
Whatever you say, monsieur.
You are the boss, no?
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow
Monsieur wish some dessert?
The mousse is very nice for you, madame.
It is, how you say, succulent.
The Sanka brand decaffeinated coffee?
The cappuccino is very nice for you, madame.
Really, we've had enough.
Madame wishes the after - dinner liqueur?
I said we've had enough.
Ah, ah, ah.
Monsieur wishes the after - dinner mint. The Frango mint.
May we just have the check please?
- And thank you for a lovely evening.
Did you believe that waiter with his funny accent?
I'm so proud of you.
You're a real gentleman, you know?
Philly, turn on the lights, will you?
Excuse me, but am I hurting you?
Miss Mallow, are you okay?
Philly, what is it?
- I killed her.
- Philly, what are you saying?
- I killed Miss Mallow!
I want to know how this happened, Philly.
I want to know what filthy thing you were doing.
I want you to tell me.
It must have been her heart.
She said she had a weak heart.
Operator, get me the police.
- Please do n't tell them I did it!
What do you want me to tell them?
That I did it?
Or that she did it herself?
They're not going to believe that, you know.
Do n't tell them anything!
You do n't have to call them!
Please hang up the phone, Lester!
I'll do anything!
Please just help me!
May I suggest we begin by covering her up?
Perhaps we should put her somewhere where it's cool so she does n't rot too quickly.
What are you gonna do with all this food?
Wo n't it spoil?
Would you rather the food spoil or Miss Mallow spoil?
Well, that should be sufficient.
Let's pop her in, shall we?
Like a sack of potatoes.
Those Europeans never did fit in.
We ca n't just leave her where she is for too long, you know.
Your father will be home in a week or two.
Suppose he takes it into his mind to get some lamb chops from his freezer?
I think your father, from what I know of him, would be quite disappointed to find Miss Mallow instead of lamb chops in his freezer, do n't you?
But it is worthy of your consideration, Philly.
Do n't you think your father would be more than disappointed to find Miss Mallow all frozen, rock hard in his freezer instead of some nice baby lamb chops?
Are n't you gonna help?
It's not my body.
Come on, Lester.
Ca n't you help me?
Boy, this is really hard.
Well, you've heard the expression "frozen stiff."
Philly, let's flip her over.
Yes, actually, I quite enjoyed it, Philly.
Yes, what is it now, Philly?
It's Miss Mallow!
She's not there!
She's not in her grave!
- She's not there.
I'm warning you, Philly.
If this is your idea of some sort of childish prank,
I, for one, am not amused.
I will not deal with this as anything other than a joke.
See what he wants.
I found this note for you in your flower garden, Philly.
"The flower you two buried had to be transplanted."
You'd be surprised at the number of people who go poking through the grounds of the wealthy at night, my boy.
So, what's next?
Gosh, Lester, I do n't know.
Lester, I just ca n't think of any other way to get the money.
Lester, you think we should be doing this?
Well, Philly, do you want Miss Mallow back?
- Then open the safe and get the 10,000.
Your father may not even notice it's missing.
What are we gonna tell my father when he comes home and discovers $10,000 missing?
What are you going to tell him when Miss Mallow's remains turn up at the police station?
Hey, Lester, look at this.
Good work, Philly.
What are you doing here now?
Why are n't you at the hotel?
Because I was sick of staying at that sleazy place.
Nicole, he'll see you.
I want him to see me.
What the hell is going on, Nicole?
A belated case of conscience maybe?
Well, that's very sweet.
Look, the old man may not be a prize, but the kid does n't deserve to have this done to him.
when you slept together, did he wet the bed?
If you do n't shut up, I'm going straight to --
Tell me what you're gonna do, sweet pants.
All right, I'll tell you.
You're gonna do precisely what I tell you to do.
Otherwise, I'll have to tell the immigration people that you're not only an illegal alien, but a felon.
Seducing a minor -- that's a criminal offense, in case you did n't know.
Please do n't run away.
I'm sorry, Philly.
You let me think that you were dead -- that I had killed you.
Was it just for the money?
Lester forced me into this mess.
What'd he do, put a gun to your head?
He threatened to tell immigration that I was working here illegally.
I could have been deported.
I had to do it.
You got your money.
Why do n't you just take it and go away?
I'm on your side, Philly.
I thought you loved me.
I do n't trust you anymore.
All right, then I'll go to the police.
Well, what do you want me to do then?
But I do n't want you arrested.
Where's my father's $10,000?
Well, can you help me try and get it back?
Of course I'll help you, Philly.
Gon na have to hurry.
First we have to find a place to hide you.
I used to hide there all the time.
Maybe we'd better hurry to put some pressure on dear Lester.
I've got some ideas about that already.
I missed you, Miss Mallow.
But we came here to ask you a favor.
We just got blackmailed for $10,000.
Have you talked to the police?
Oh, Mr. Travis, wo n't you please help us?
You need a policeman, not a tennis instructor.
But we need you, not a real cop.
Me, a policeman?
This guy is a real bully and he scares easily.
So all you have to do is act like a tough cop.
- But I do n't know how to act like a cop.
- Just be hard and tough.
And maybe we could watch Dirty Harry on television tonight.
I'm with the police department.
I'm Detective Jack Travis.
- This is the Fillmore residence, but I am not Mr. Fillmore, if that's what you're asking.
I'd like to ask a few questions.
- I'm the houseman and chauffeur.
My name is Lester Lewis.
But I really must object, sir.
- Shut up, Lester.
Now then, Lester.
Is there a Miss Nicole Mallow here?
That is, she used to be here.
- Where did she go?
She was n't happy here I'm afraid.
We received a tip that she has met with foul play.
This tip said she was homicided.
Miss Mallow is as alive as you or I.
I want to see her room now.
I told you you'd find nothing in Miss Mallow's room.
What is the point of looking through my room?
Gee, Lester, you really do have a very interesting sense of decoration.
Real interesting, Lester.
This a friend of yours?
Real cute, Lester.
You know, you're a real cutie- pie.
This is particularly cute.
This, I do n't even want to know from.
Planning a little trip, Lester?
This must look just divine on you... if you lose a little weight.
These are Miss Mallow's clothes.
She did n't have room for all of them and she asked that we keep them here and send them on after she settled in Tucson.
Is n't that right, Philly?
Can I get you something to drink, Officer?
Some tea, a coffee, a beer perhaps?
Lester, there's more dirty laundry here than I thought.
What is this big red spot here?
Miss Mallow was fond of eating lasagna in bed, and she frequently spilled it.
Lester, I do n't believe a word you've told me so far.
And as far as I'm concerned, Miss Mallow was homicided.
I think I'm gonna take you down.
Give me a couple of hours, I can prove she's still alive.
How are you gonna do that with her in Tucson?
Gee, Lester, are you sure it was Tucson?
- She's not in Tucson.
This is gonna be tough.
Well, she's having an abortion.
I did n't want the boy to know.
That's good you did that.
Save that boy any pain.
She'll be back in three hours.
I'm gonna see you in two hours.
And you better be able to prove that girl is alive or I'm gonna book you for murder one.
You ca n't book me for murder.
If you do n't have a body, you do n't have a case.
Come on, Lester.
Up, up, up, up.
Now do n't get any bright ideas about leaving town
Now, I'm gonna see you in two hours from right now.
Yes, I do.
Thank you, Officer.
You know, Lester, I think it's shocking the way that man treats you.
I do n't know why you put up with it.
I'm looking for the young foreign woman I checked in here the other day.
It's a matter of some urgency.
You do n't know where she is now?
If it's the woman that I'm thinking of, I think I checked her out earlier this morning.
Did she mention where she was going?
Walter, will you get that cat out of the lobby?
Are you quite certain you do n't recall her mentioning where she might be headed?
Well, now that you mention it, I believe she said something about going to Tucson.
He's looking all over for you.
You do n't know him.
He'll pick up the money and run.
Sherman, can we borrow a car?
Sure, come on.
If we catch him now, I'm sure he'll have the money with him.
- Philly, I ca n't drive.
- Neither can I. Can you?
Come on, Sherman.
I ca n't help it!
Why did n't you tell us before?
- Get off the sidewalk!
Do n't hit that car!
I'm trying not to!
Watch out, there's a cop!
You just missed that --
- Do n't hit him, will you?
- I'm trying not to!
Please, Mr. Green, it's terribly terribly important.
Please, yes, please.
Yes, thank you! Yes!
Please, Mr. Green.
Are you ready, Lester?
I'm ready, Mr. Green!
Mr. Green, we need your help.
You want a chase, you sicko?
I'll give you a chase.
Lester, over here.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Green.
I've been waiting 20 minutes.
It's been a difficult day.
And where's your tie?
I always want you to wear a tie.
Lester, you take this and the baggage is in the baggage area.
- I'll get that, sir.
- Lester, let me help you.
- I can get that.
- No, I insist.
- Really, I insist.
- No, it's my job.
I'll be right back, sir.
Philly, please, please.
Well, I was late picking up my employer, Mr. Fillmore.
May I present Detective Travis, my employer, Mr. Fillmore.
- You're Fillmore?
Hold on, Lester.
Nice to see you again, Jack.
Oh, Nicole and I are old friends.
- And you're Fillmore?
Well, it seems it's a mystery to all of us.
Shall we be going, sir?
Oh, you get the rest of the baggage and I'll take this one.
Well, you've certainly changed a lot lately.
I know, but most of the credit belongs to you.
And Lester too, of course.
Philly, I'm going to miss you.
Well, I mean I think that it's time for me to leave.
Well, for one thing, we'll never be able to keep our affair a secret from your father.
And the moment he found out, he'd fire me immediately.
I guess you're right.
But I do n't want you to leave.
I'll miss you.
We'll always keep in touch.
Anyway, you're ready to be on your own now.
Where are you gonna go?
I let you know where I am.
If you're gonna get a new job, you're gonna have to have a letter of reference from my father.
Well, your father might not think I've been working long enough.
I did n't mean for him to write it.
But I know what he'd say if he knew you as well as I do.
"She was passionate about her household duties."
"And she kept things well in hand."
"She gave everything she had to her employer."
Lester, I'll see you at 3:00 then?
- Hi, Jan.
- Hey, do you have Mr. Marks for Civics?
Great, I'll see you there.
I'll see you sixth period.
Oh, Miss Phipps.
I did n't recognize you.
You've changed so much since last June.
I know, and I'd like to thank you for the advice you gave me.
To find girls whose age is more appropriate for me.
Oh, it went very well.
I'd like to talk to you about it in detail.
Great, I'd love to.
Can we discuss it over dinner tonight?
Why do n't I have my chauffeur pick you up at 8:00 then?
You're my good boy!
Honey, I do n't have much time!
Something came up at work, honey.
Daddy is not gonna be home for a while.
You ca n't go back to the house, Penny.
I've altered him.
Everything is positioning nicely.
There he is, doctor Calico!
Oh, his guts will spill.
Never, I'll never talk.
As the package arrived I think it might make our dear friend a bit more communicative.
I'm sending an agent to pick it up.
Gorgeous! Have him bring it to me on the first flight.
Bolt, let's go!
We only need the girl!
- Where is Calico?
I'm not talking to you.
Bolivia, Bolivia, Calico is in Bolivia!
I should have known!
Come on Bolt, let's go.
Bolivia, there is a flight leaving in 10 minutes.
Good job, buddy.
That's a keeper!
It's allright tough guy, you caught them all.
- We got a boom mike.
- That's a boom mike.
The dog could've seen that.
Uh, who cares if the dog sees a boom mike?
Forgive me for answering a question with a question, but who are you?
Let me ask you, Mindy from the network...
What do you see here?
- "The dog" she says.
Am I missing something?
You're missing everything, Mindy.
You see a dog.
I see an animal that believes with every fiber of his being, every fiber that the girl he loves is in mortal danger.
Never, Mindy from the network.
We jump through hoops to make sure Bolt believes everything is real.
It's why we do n't miss marks.
And it's why we most certainly do not let the dog see boom mikes!
Because, Mindy from the network, if the dog believes it, the audience believes it.
And our focus groups tell us 18 to 35 year olds are unhappy.
They're not happy with happy.
So maybe you should, I do n't know, spend a little less time worrying about the dog's method acting, and more time figuring out how to stop 20 year olds in Topeka from changing the channel.
Because if you lose so much as half a rating point, so help me, I will fire everyone in this room, starting with you!
How's that for real?
You saved me again, Bolt.
No more bad guys.
Do you want some food, Bolty? Huh?
You've got them, Bolt, no one is gonna hurt me.
Bolt, look at me.
I'm fine, see?
Come here buddy, come here!
Go, get it Bolt!
Well, what we have here?
Your old buddy, Mister Carrot!
You know I have to go.
And there she is, my little superstar!
Let's get to that "Teen" vogue cover shoot.
Mam, I wanna take Bolt home for this weekend.
A little girl and her dog.
So I can bring Bolt home?
As your friend, I say yes, absolutely but as your agent, I have to remind you.
He has to stay right here.
But he never gets to be a real dog.
Good enough for everybody?
Let's get out of here.
I wanna take Bolt home.
I have a little girl at home, love of my life.
I would do anything for her.
And I would trade her for you in a heartbeat!
That reminds me, uh, we need to begin over to wardrobe.
I like to start with an evil laugh.
You may have one today Bolt, but in the end we will get your little Penny.
For you've choosen to follow the path of evil, ultimately we'll destroy you, along with your fiendish puppet master.
- I know. Okay, watch this.
She is a goner, dog.
Yeah and then he will execute her!
I would super bark you both back into the hole you crawled out of but I need you alive because I got a little message for you to take back to your green - eyed man.
- Is what long?
Is it a long message?
Because I have a horrible memory.
And then we can pass it on green - eyed man together.
I do n't care how the message is translated, alright?
Tell the green - eyed man, that I will not sleep, I will not rest until my Penny is safe from his evil clutches.
Way too many words!
Anyway, I'll do my best!
Get back here, you...
I'll never let them get you, Penny!
You ready, Bolt?
Ready on the propel bars.
And track with them!
Calico's super computer.
If we can access it we'll find and learn where they're keeping my father.
It brings tears to my eyes!
Your father's discoveries could be a great use to our organization.
I'm sure, he will be more commutating now that I've got his "lucky Penny"!
World domination is waiting my grasp!
Bolt, it's okay Bolt.
- Listen to him.
- He needs to know I'm okay.
- No, you're not okay.
Yes, it is! It's a pin!
Let's take the pin and put it in this conversation.
- What's that reminds me up?
It's a big push.
Let's give her some air.
Let's not crowd the talent.
You could do a chuckle, like a mildly upset chuckle after my evil laugh.
Bolt, come back!
- Bolt, help!
- I'm coming Penny!
Hold on, Penny.
You're cool, Bolty!
There is no time for formalities, brothers.
- Wow! What're you doing?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You wanna sniff mine first?
- Not from around here, are you?
Are you lost sweety?
Why ca n't I bend these stupid bars?
You got your head stucked pretty good, huh guy?
He's got his mellon stucked.
I will not take it easy, because I'm missing my person.
Like this, turn and pull.
Forget about it, you'll be out no time.
They're weaken me.
- Polystyrofoam packing peanuts.
Have you seen a man with a green eye?
You look familiar. Joey, look at this guy's mug.
I gotta tell ya, I never forget a face.
- I know this dog.
- Yeah, yeah, me too!
I gotta remember, it's gonna kill me.
No, I do n't know.
- Yeah, yeah, Kelvin, the Labrador.
You gotta gimme something here, cause this is redonkulous.
You pigeons are useless.
I need someone on the inside, someone close to the green - eyed man.
Yeah, a cat.
I think we know just the cat.
Right on time, Saul.
Okay, Saul, nice work.
Let's find some mustard next time.
- What a boy!
- Good day, Mittens.
It was a slow week.
You hear this, Louie?
I'm starving here.
And when the old stomach starts talking, it's not talking to me.
So, I'll talk to the claws, but in exchange next week, all your food comes to me.
- But that's not our deal!
I bring you half, you give me protection!
Mark my words, Mittens.
Yeah, I'm really scared now.
- You know why I'm here!
Come on, Mittens.
Just tell the guy where she is.
- Tell the dog, make him happy.
- Yeah, yeah, come on, Mittens! Tell him!
Joey, Vinnie, Bobby, my boys!
Would you tell the crazy canine that he's got the wrong cat?
- You got her, pal!
- That's her!
- She's the one!
Hey Joey, do we go to far on this?
This is the best day in my life.
You work for Ben and Bart, who work with the man green - eye.
- I do n't know what you're talking about.
- This is becoming tiring so cat in fact, I feel a yawn coming on.
I know where Penny is.
Yeah, they have her.
It's in the genes.
But if you put me down, I'll show you where she is.
Every bone in my evil cat body is telling me not to betray the trust of the green - eyed man.
Okay, this is a top, top secret map of the entire earth!
Now, we're over here, by the green lady with the big torch.
By the waffle with the sun glasses!
Now all you need to do is get from here to there.
Well, I told you where you find her, so if you'll just untie me, I'll be on my way.
I'll release you cat, when we found Penny.
She said that to me, not 10 minutes ago.
Listen Cujo, I got some pretty wicked claws under these mitts, do not, I beg of you do not make me bring out these bad boys!
- What are you doing?
If I stare at the lock really hard, it'll burst into flames and melt.
Slow down you screwy borrowed of mind...
Now move your butt.
I know that dog.
I've seen him somewhere.
You remember it tonight, when you're perching.
- I've got some good news!
That, I mean which means just absolutely nothing, if Bolt is still missing.
It's okay, baby.
- He must be so scared.
- Scared? This is Bolt we're talking about.
He's not scared of anything.
I bet Bolt would want you to the tonight show.
I just... or maybe not.
Bolt loves you very much sweety.
And you're here.
He could n't have gone far.
So, if you got super powers, I guess that would make you, what like some kind a super dog?
- That information is classified.
- I have super bark.
I really ca n't talk about it. It's classified.
I suggest you pipe down and take me to Penny.
You're awfully attached to this Penny character, huh wags?
- She is my person.
- Oh, please. She's a person.
What is this red liquid coming from my paw?
It's called blood, hero!
- Do I need it?
So if you want it to keep inside your body where it belongs, you should stop jumping off trucks doing eighty on the interstate!
That stuff, it weakens me!
- Allright, that's it. I've had with you.
I'm gonna... Uhmm... I'm gonna seriously wound you!
I'm gonna seriously wound you with this styrofoam!
You do n't know the power of styrofoam!
And I'm about to unleash it!
- The power of the styrofoam!
Alright, cat. Okay, you win.
I'll untie you.
- No, no, no.
I'll take you to Penny.
Okay, you have two seconds to tell me what you've implanted in me, cat!
I ca n't think straight!
- Where is the antidote?
- Okay, okay!
Go on, use the dog face.
You know, beg. Do the dog face!
Taking same tie to the one dog on earth, he does n't know how to beg.
If you want the food the antidote, you're gonna have to do exactly what I say.
No, not likely.
You're a degenerate creature of darkness.
Yeah, yeah, granted but that's it.
- This is stupid.
Head up! Down.
Now, a little smile.
Soup is on, baby!
Go Larry, go Larry, go Larry!
This time we'll do it my way!
Well, hello puppy. Did you come for some of grandma's butter bean dumplings?
I have n't eating like this in ages.
Do n't get used to it. We gotta keep moving.
But this place is a gold mine. What's wrong with you?
In my eyes deceive me?
Oh, could it be?
You're Bolt, the super dog.
- Ah, yeah, yeah. We've established that.
- Who are you?
We have for us a legend.
Bolt, the super dog!
You can outrun speeding missiles, and burn through solid metal with his heat vision.
Wait a minute, you've seen the super bark?
- Have you been observing me?
I watch you all the time.
But I'm always so vigilant!
No one can avoid my detection!
- You are a phantom.
- Ah, if you say so...
- It's like, we're twins.
- Yeah, scary.
- So, where is Penny?
- She was kidnapped by the green - eyed man.
She could be in grave...
But I've captured this cat.
How did you sleep at night?
Penny is the most wonderful person ever.
She loves Bolt and he is awesome.
And you're a monster!
How dare you destruct their relationship with your evil!
I can take her Bolty.
- Easy, easy, Rhino.
You're right, we need her alive.
- I'm lightning quick.
Plus, I'll keep the cat in check.
- The road would be rough.
- I have a ball.
- There is no turning back.
- Easy will be parley equation.
- My limit is one.
- He is coming with us.
Move it prisoner, we're losing daylight.
I've got a better idea.
Am I missing anything, Rhino?
Just the knowledge that every minute spent in your company becomes the new greatest minute of my life!
- Calm down, cat. You're with me.
- That's the problem.
Oh, would you be relax?
Every time you get this on the "magic box", it was awesome!
You know, "magic box", people stare at.
Is this the magic box that moving pictures on it?
Yeah and Bolt's pictures are the best.
Bolt, guys! Hear me out!
- Let it begin!
What are you doing?
Mittens, take my paw.
I need you alive.
You're not really a
Ouch! You moron!
- Stop it! I'm trying to help him.
Do n't worry Bolt!
I'll stop her.
- Let it go, you monster!
The real world hurts, does n't it?
I'll get a ladder.
It's an entertainment for people.
Nothing you think is real as real!
Think about it Bolt.
Yeah, gone nuts.
You leave me no choice.
Oh, the super bark.
Bolt, we gotta run!
He is white with a lightning bolt on his side.
Please help me get my friend back.
Look who we found young lady!
- They found him!
That is not Bolt.
Well, that depands on how you look at it.
I pretended that baseball glove was a bicycle.
And I rode it to school every day.
- It's not him.
Look kid, it's time we are honest with you.
- Good people with families.
- But Bolt is still out there.
- I know, we feel for you.
We need you to let Bolt go.
It must be made of styrofoam!
I'll get us out of here.
You ca n't, Bolt.
No super strength, no super bark.
Listen to me, okay?
We've been taking to a place where humans go animal shopping, alright?
They always pick the cute ones.
The ones that look like you, Bolt.
But the rest of us never come back out.
I said, I'll get us out of here, alright?
I've been expecting your call.
You'll liquefy whatever brains you have left.
I can not be contained in any container.
That styrofoam is a wicked stuff.
There is no truck that I know that can keep Bolt and Rhino!
Rhino, what are you doing here?
Oh, nothing. I was enjoying a new thing stroll and then I just pop the hatch on hack the containment unit!
- Yes, I did.
Alright, let's go get the prisoner back.
I ca n't do it.
- You are Bolt.
Who single handedly destroyed the green - eyed man's under sea labs?
And who foiled his plan to infiltrate the Olympics with nastic cyborgs?
- Who, Bolt, who? Who?
You can, Bolt.
Because, all over this planet there are animals who feel like they ca n't.
You did it, Rhino!
You saved the day. "
They need a hero, Bolt!
Someone, who never mind what the odds, will do what's right.
They need a hero to tell them that sometimes the impossible can become possible, if you're awesome!
Well, you're right about one thing, Rhino.
Mittens does need a hero.
I guess I'll have to do.
Now, who is going to save that cat?
I'll get my ball.
- Good night, Ester.
- Good night, Lloyd.
Lloyd Spoony, you jump out and scare me, and I'm gonna pepper spray again!
I'll snap his neck.
We need to get away him from that door.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm busting you out.
You came all the way back here, for me?
- Crazy day for you, huh?
Hey, hey, hey!
What is twisting your giblets?
Hey, wait! Where did you get that hamster?
Give it, give it.
What did you do my new truck?
- Both you boys need serious help!
- We need a ride.
- I got a big one.
My whole life, I wanted to see a real life super bark.
Being a regular dog, not like the greatest geek in the world, okay?
You know why we hate dogs?
But what are dogs do?
Slubber, sleep, chase tails, chew shoes.
You know, most dogs living in a place like this.
- And this is your dog ball.
You seem to know a lot about this places.
Yeah, I did my time in one of these, but I'm more be an alley cat heart, you know?
Sprung out first chance I got, never looked back.
He is so awesome!
He is beyond awesome.
He is "be awesome"!
I think it's about time I introduce you a regular dog peace to resistance.
And stick your tongue out!
Why do n't you try it?
It's really a dog thing.
Hey Bolt, wake up.
Come on, I've got a surprise for you.
Okay, okay, no picking.
Best in the globe, baby!
Just let me give you a grand tour, okay?
And this one is all yours.
- Oh, I found this really soft pillow thing for you.
I found some styrofoam and I stuffed it inside.
- Check it out!
Total privacy and completely sound proof!
- Okay, I lied. It's not sound proof.
- Mittens, I ca n't stay here.
We're one waffle away from Penny.
You still going back to her?
Mittens, she is my person.
Look at me, Bolt.
Now, how about this, huh?
Is this look real to you?
How about that, Bolt?
She is an actress.
- She is just pretending.
There is no Penny.
No, no Bolt.
That's what they do, okay?
They act like they love you. They act like they'll be there forever.
And then one day, they pack up all their stuff and move away, and take their love with them.
And leave their declawed cat behind to fend for herself!
They leave her wondering what she did wrong.
I'm sorry Mittens, but...
- Get out of here, Bolt!
- Just get out of here, Bolt!
You take care of Mittens.
- Morning, cat.
- Where is Bolt?
He had to face the green - eyed man alone.
- Where are you going?
But he does n't need us anymore.
Trust me, I've seen that a million times before.
But if Bolt's taught me anything, it's that you never abandon a friend in a time of need!
When your team mates in trouble, you go.
Whether they ask or not, you go!
He went the other way.
I'm really a big fan of yours, brother.
This is my friend, Tom.
Tom, say what's up.
And this is our personal assistant, Billy who is supposed to wait up on the wire.
Okay Billy, that was horrifying what you just did.
Wanna make something useful?
Go get me some bread crumbs.
Whole - wheat is not the same thing as whole grain, Billy!
- Not the same, Billy!
- Do not come out with whole - wheat!
- Okay guys, but I really gotta get going.
- I know. I know you're a busy dog.
But if you got a second for a lovely picture idea for your show, Tom has better pitching.
- Audiences love aliens.
I'll tell you what, if you guys can help me find Penny, the girl from the television show I'd love hear more about this aliens idea, but on the way.
- We got a nibble!
- Do n't freak out.
This is how you blew with Nemo.
We open exterior outer space scenery.
Calico comes for your Penny.
And then you squish him.
And as the tractor beam is pulling Penny and you to aliens' mother ship we fade to black.
And we have a great pop song for the end credits.
He is so on board!
The most terrifying place on earth!
Rhino, hold up!
All of my training has prepared me for this moment.
Prepare yourself, follow man beast!
I will eat your pancreas with your spleen and then I will rip your liver out of your...
You're so cute with your little whiskers.
Oh, you came back!
Bolt, I thought I've lost you.
You're my good boy.
Let's move to stage 7 and do it for real.
- I know, honey.
Go! Go, go!
It's okay, boy, come here.
What are you doing here?
You were right about her, Mittens.
She, uh, well... it was n't real.
No Bolt, it is real.
I was in there just now, I saw her face after you left.
She's broken hearted.
She does n't want just any dog, she loves you.
She's your person, Bolt, and you are her dog.
- Mittens, be quiet!
- No, you need to hear this!
Please! Oh, my gosh!
The stage! Yeah, you better run!
- I'm on your six.
- What are we do?
- Is anyone still in there?
- I do n't know.
- It's a good day to die!
- Not on my watch, rodent!
I knew you'll come back.
Bolt, just... just go on and out.
It'll be okay.
Have you seen my daughter?
Has anyone seen my baby?
- Did you hear that?
- It's coming from over there!
You're gonna be just fine.
- She is stable.
This is so great!
No, no, wait!
Let's put a pin on it.
I'm afraid your injuries far more severe then we've previously thought, my dear.
We have to completely reconstruct your face.
At least Calico wo n't be able to recognize me.
That is totally unrealistic.
- Absolutely "redonkulous".
Hey, silly doggy!
That's a keeper.
You wanna go play outside, huh?
You wanna go play outside?
- Is that dog look familiar?
The Ellcrys will bare a seed that must be carried to a place called Safehold.
Arion, my father, all gone.
And now you are King.
It's like he's inside my head.
Making me do things.
What are those creatures doing here?
The Gnomes come in peace, to fight the demons as our allies.
It's the Bloodfire, I need to get inside.
The Ellcrys is dying.
As it sheds its leaves, a demon army forms, preparing to unleash its evil on our world.
We're out of time, Amberle.
The last leaf has fallen in Arborlon.
I ca n't believe it's really you.
I've been listening to your voice since I was just a girl.
You were never just a girl.
Every step you've taken was meant to bring you here.
The Bloodfire is the earth's life force.
It's where the past, present, and future meet.
It is your destiny.
But I do n't understand.
You were chosen, like I once was.
Fate has tied us to the Ellcrys.
As I end, you will begin.
But I can save you, I have the seed.
You are the seed, Amberle.
Wil, what happened?
You lost too much blood.
But the stones brought you back.
I guess you're a healer after all.
She did n't make it out.
We need to open it back up.
I warned you your feelings for Wil would hold you back.
You must be willing to let him go.
You must choose to sacrifice yourself.
Then you have doomed us all.
Hey, what happened in there?
But you have the seed?
But the last leaf has fallen in Arborlon.
The Princess has emerged from the Bloodfire.
She's coming home?
Yes, but the Dagda Mor is aware of her presence.
So we must prepare.
I'll send word to the Scouts.
Move the citizens to the tunnels and mobilize the army.
That would be the wise decision, Your Highness.
I'm still not used to people calling me that.
Only a king knows the weight of a crown.
30 years ago, I stood under very similar circumstances beside your father.
Did you have any words of inspiration for him?
Anyone remember how to get out of this place?
And when we do, how do we get back to Arborlon?
Nobody said it was gonna be easy.
The Demons outnumber us a thousand to one.
Allanon assures me that Amberle has the seed and is on her way.
Slanter, your men will form a perimeter and push into the woods beyond the Sanctuary.
Commander Tilton and I will take the Elvin army and fortify the Sanctuary itself.
We'll be the last line of defense for whatever breaks through.
Wil, help me!
Help me close this thing!
Just leave it, we can outrun them!
I bought you some time.
We have to go back together.
No, you have to go back.
Do n't you get it?
We all have a part to play.
I'm doing mine, and now it's up to you.
No, I'm not leaving you here.
Wil, it's not up to you.
I'll come back for you, I promise.
Wil, we have to go.
She wants us to go.
I never meant to hurt you.
It's okay, it's okay.
How can I help?
I need you to get me far away, somewhere where I ca n't hurt anybody.
Bandon, I ca n't.
Catania do you trust me?
Then, get ready to scream.
Give me the keys or I snap her neck.
Just let us go, he's not going to hurt you.
Do n't touch her!
He should n't have touched you.
Nothing from the scouts.
We should head down.
We were supposed to get married, remember?
I'm sorry it took the end of the world for me to realize what a fool I've been.
Lead the way, Commander.
I have never been so happy to see anything in my entire life.
We ca n't get through, not on horseback.
Not without them seeing us.
No, there has to be a way.
We have to get to the Ellcrys.
All right, we'll need cover then.
We need to find somewhere safe to wait for dark.
I know somewhere, come on.
It wo n't be long.
I know, I just...
I wish we could have met before all this.
Hey... we made it.
We're almost home.
And when we finish this, when everyone's safe, we'll have all the time in the world to do things differently.
But what if we did n't have time?
Do n't talk like that, we're gonna make it.
I'm not afraid anymore.
Eretria was right, this is my part.
I know what I have to do and... it's okay.
But I need to tell you something first.
I love you, Wil Ohmsford.
And I'm not ready to let you go, not yet.
It's dark, we should head out.
Nothing, it's...
Let's go save a tree.
With it, we can send this demon horde back to the Forbidding.
For this to happen, we must buy them time.
We must hold this line... and defend the Ellcrys at all costs.
I know we can win this war because I have stood alongside your King Eventine and, as fate would have it, I now stand alongside his son,
Your princess is out there, right now.
Scared... just like you.
Giving everything she has to save us all.
And if we die tonight, let us fall so the Ellcrys may rise again!
So every race in the Four Lands may have a future to call its own!
Is there a secret way in?
No, not this far out.
Die, you bastard.
Perfect timing as usual.
I wish I could say the same for you but the idea was to get here before the demons arrived.
See, told you he'd be happy to see us.
The Gnomes are with us.
Are you ready to see this through, Princess?
What are you waiting for?
Run for the Ellcrys, now!
All right, where's the seed?
Oh, please do n't say you dropped it.
I do n't think I could take that right now.
It's me, Wil.
I'm the seed.
I have to become the Ellcrys.
That's how we save it.
How we save everyone.
I mean, what happens to...
I need you to understand.
I wo n't make it otherwise.
Please talk to me.
I know you're in there somewhere.
Ca n't hear anything.
She will speak when she is ready.
Be patient, Wil.
You knew this was gonna happen, did n't you?
It would not have helped if you knew.
You just decided that on your own.
Did n't she deserve to know?
Amberle made the decision, not me, Wil.
So when you told me that I could protect her, that was a lie too?
You made me believe she could be saved.
Instead, I lost another person that I loved.
Saving the Four Lands in the process, Wil.
Do not forget that.
I told you that... magic comes with a price.
You did n't say it was her life!
Your father would have been proud of your actions today.
I had a dream Bandon was alone, drowning in a sea of black.
You wanted to see me, Your Grace.
I wanted to thank you for everything.
It was my duty.
I sent soldiers to find my brother's body, but there was no sign of him or the Warlock sword.
I saw him in there, Allanon.
Even in that twisted form... it was Arion.
He asked me to kill him.
The Dagda Mor's cruelty had no bounds.
Have n't been to the Sanctuary yet to see Amberle.
I know her sacrifice saved us, but I just ca n't believe that she's gone.
She is still with you, My Grace.
She is watching over us all.
For what it's worth, I'm grateful to you for showing me who I am.
I sense that our journey has just begun.
The Dagda Mor may be gone, but his presence has stirred other evils.
Then let them come.
But there's something I've gotta do first.
You're going to Safehold.
You do n't know whether the Rover girl is alive or dead.
The mind - reading thing, still really annoying.
I promised Eretria I'd go back.
I'm not gonna lose her too.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs, I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.
I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats, and I am the only one fast enough to stop them.
Iris's mom is alive.
And you thought you could pay me to walk away from my own daughter.
Last time you walked away for free.
When you created the singularity, you also created a breach... a portal connecting our two earths.
You really think he's just bringing these guys here to kill me?
Zoom is obsessed with destroying me.
Now he wants to destroy you.
I'm starting to perceive things... horrible things.
We have to merge the inner and outer event horizons by separating in the eye of it.
Ronnie died saving me, and I'm so sorry.
Professor Stein, can you hear me?
Everyone secretly thinks they've figured out what their life is gonna be like, but what no one ever considers is that life has it s own plans for you, whether you like them or not.
You can either embrace the change and move forward, or fight it, and be left behind.
I knew you could do it.
That was some touchdown, man. You won us the game!
Hey, that's not what the cheerleaders were saying.
Jefferson, great game.
I'm not the only one that noticed.
Lot of scouts in the stands tonight, and after that touchdown, they all pulled out their cell phones.
You're gonna get your pick of colleges, son.
You really think so?
You get home and celebrate with your mom.
Hey, hey, come on, man, I got you!
Cisco, we're losing him!
He's getting worse.
Look, I did what I could to re-engineer Doctor Wells's original stabilizer to quell the reaction, but I do n't know what he used as a power source.
Best I could find was the one from his wheelchair.
And how long will that last?
I think we got a few days tops.
And he's stuck in bed?
Yeah, when he wakes up,
I'm gonna transfer the stabilizer to this, give him a power cane, get him moving.
When the Particle Accelerator exploded, the dark matter that collided with Professor Stein fused with the Firestorm matrix and altered the normal molecular processes that occurs within his body.
Those highly reactive molecules needed something to bond with in order to stabilize.
And that's where Ronnie came in.
Yes, and now that Ronnie is no longer a part of Professor Stein...
Those molecules do n't have anything to bond to.
And the longer he goes without merging, the more unstable he becomes.
All right, so, what do we do?
Are we just gonna make a Tinder app for potential meta-humans?
Cause I'm pretty sure merging with Stein and randomly bursting into flames sounds like the biggest "swipe left" of all time.
I mean, even if we could find someone willing,
Stein ca n't just merge with whoever he wants.
No he ca n't, but I have done some research, and found two potential candidates that might be compatible with him.
They both were affected by the dark matter, and they were both admitted to the hospital showing symptoms of gene rearrangement mutation.
And they both share the same blood type as Professor Stein and Ronnie.
I mean, this is more than organ donation. We'll need more than tissue typing to see if their bodies are compatible.
If I can isolate the genetic locus of the two candidates and cross -reference it with the mutations in Professor Stein, I might be able to find a match and save his life.
What do you need to do that?
Damn, that was fast even for you.
I may have skipped the asking for permission part.
Let's see if we ca n't find a match.
You were two in that picture.
So we took you to the park afterwards to cheer you up, gave you your first ice cream cone, which was a mistake, because all we heard the next month was,
"Mint - choplat chip, mint - choplat chip."
That's where the obsession started.
If you do n't want to meet your mother tomorrow, I get it.
No, it's okay. I want to meet her.
I need to meet her.
My brave baby girl.
Hey, I was just looking for you.
No, no, no, I just wanted to show you this.
These were just found in an alley off of Eastwood Avenue.
And I have an eyewitness that says he saw a shark walking on land... a man-shark.
Sounds like a bad sci - fi movie.
Or awesome sci - fi movie.
- But, I mean, nothing seems impossible now that we have meta-humans, right?
And I thought it would be fun, you know, for us to work together again on a case.
It's just, you know, meta - humans are n't really my thing.
look, how about I just...
I'll run a test, see where the teeth came from.
That would be amazing.
It's good, I was just gonna go and canvas the area, see what else I can dig up, and Barry here agreed to run some tests for me.
If I did n't know any better, I'd say you were flirting with my partner.
What are you talking about?
What is it with you and Iris and my partners?
Eh, she's pretty nervous about seeing her mother after all these years.
It's about Professor Stein.
All right, thanks.
Well, I must admit, I never imagined the Sphinx's riddle about a man requiring three legs would ever apply to me, but if this device keeps me mobile, then I will gratefully oblige.
Hopefully, you wo n't need it for much longer.
There was no agglutination in the blood samples, and cross - matching was negative for both, and it appears that the dark matter from the Particle Accelerator explosion mutated their genes in a very similar way it did to yours.
I think they're both potential matches.
So who do we go with?
Well, my first choice is Henry Hewitt.
He graduated summa cum laude from Hudson University with a double major in Applied Physics and Bioengineering.
A Hudson boy, I like him already.
High school quarterback, 4.0 student.
He's got the physical attributes.
And it looks like more of his alleles match than Hewitt's.
On paper, perhaps, but Hewitt is a scientist.
Clearly, he's trying to make something of his life.
I think he'd be open to something like this.
I think we should meet with both of them before we make a decision.
I'll see if I can get Hewitt here.
All right, in the meantime, we'll go meet with Jefferson Jackson.
And I will try to find something else to help keep you stable.
Are you sure this is the right place?
Jefferson's a mechanic.
Could indicate a strong technical aptitude.
Oh, prone to allergies.
That's definitely a negative, not to mention his taste in music.
Would you prefer Celine Dion instead?
People call me Jax.
It's a small, newly formed agency.
You need to see our licenses?
We are compiling data on people who were affected by the Particle Accelerator explosion two years ago.
Look, man, I lost enough time in my life 'cause of that stupid thing going wrong.
Now, you do n't got a car I can fix, I ca n't help you.
If you would consider coming back to S.T.A.R. Labs with us,
I believe we can help you.
Look, I already told you, I do n't talk about that night.
Because that's when everything changed.
I got hit hard.
When I woke up, I was in the hospital.
The look on my mom's face, I knew any dreams I had of playing pro ball were over.
Here, it's just... it's our number.
Just think about it, okay?
Thank you for putting this together, Joseph.
Iris's idea, not mine.
Iris... this is Francine.
Can I get you a coffee or something?
I ca n't get over what a beautiful young woman you've become.
Why are you here?
Why now, after two decades?
I want to make this right with you.
How about you start by apologizing for walking out on us?
There's so much you do n't know.
I'm sure that you've been through a great deal, and I can appreciate you feeling like this is suddenly the right time for you to want me in your life, but that does n't mean that it's the right time for me.
No, Dad, it's okay.
So I want you to hear this from me.
I do n't hate you, Francine.
I do wish you well, but we have lived separate lives for over 20 years.
Let's keep it that way.
I've always thought my destiny was for greater things. And people, of course.
Well, when it's all said and done, flying will be the least impressive of your new abilities.
Man finally achieves the promise of the Atomic Age.
Caitlin, what's going on?
Hi, I'm glad you're back. This is Dr. Henry Hewitt.
This is Barry Allen and Professor Martin Stein.
I've read all your papers back at Hudson, especially on transmutation.
- You're a legend.
- Oh, please.
- Is n't he great?
He's got an ego the size of Texas, but, yeah, he's all right.
We just need more time.
We do n't have more time.
I could n't find another power source for the cane and that thing's running out.
You told him the details of the Firestorm Matrix?
Absolutely, becoming Firestorm is a huge life change.
He needs to know what he's getting himself into.
If I remember correctly, vector, variance, hypotenuse...
Aw, look at that, that's so cute.
We'll have two Professor Steins if this works.
When I put this splicer on your chest you're gonna feel a rush.
That's a molecular primer being released into your body.
Firestorm Matrix will take over.
No time like the present.
Something's supposed to be happening, right?
Why is n't it working?
Well, looks like you two are n't compatible after all.
So all this was for nothing?
Believe me, no one is more disappointed than I am.
Next time, try to get your act together before you get someone's hopes up.
Move the show - and - tell to next Tuesday, remind me to call Richard tomorrow about the shareholders meeting, and where are we with the replacement for Doctor Snow?
Detective West, thank you for coming.
Doctor McGee, this is my new partner,
I was saddened by Detective Thawne's passing.
Please extend my condolences to your daughter.
Thank you. On the phone you mentioned this was a sensitive matter.
It is, and I called you directly because I've always appreciated your discretion in the past.
Of course, can you tell me what was stolen?
It's not so much what was stolen, but who stole it.
The person who broke into my facility last night was Harrison Wells.
Harrison Wells is dead.
I seem to recall the circumstances around his passing were a bit inconclusive.
Is there any possibility he could be alive?
I knew the man for over 20 years.
I know who I saw.
The only thing distinctively different was... he's walking again.
Like I said, I trust your discretion.
You have full access to the facility.
First a shark - man, now a dead man walking.
We need to call Barry, get him in here first.
Barry ca n't hear about any of this.
He's got a friend who's sick who he needs his help, and Harrison Wells is the man who murdered his mother.
Once he hears that...
Well, you better learn, quick.
This is the last time you ever show up here.
I needed to talk to you again.
Iris and I do not want you in our lives.
Go home, live your life.
Joe, there's something else.
A few months ago, I started getting weak.
The doctors ran a bunch of tests, they could n't figure it out.
But finally, they did.
Supposedly it's pretty common among ex-addicts.
Told me I had till the end of the year if I'm lucky.
Is... is that why you came back?
I just want my daughter to know me... this me.
I'm really glad you decided to come.
I thought S.T.A.R. Labs had to shut down.
It's under new management.
Whoa, what kind of treadmill is that?
So, let's get started.
You got some kind of "Billion Dollar Man" technology that gonna fix my knee?
Actually, Jax, this is n't about fixing your knee.
When the Particle Accelerator exploded, the energy wave that collided with you is known as "dark matter."
And it did n't just hurt your knee.
It... it changed the molecular structure of your body.
Whoa, hold on, Grey.
So you're saying I'm like one of those meta-humans I keep hearing about on the news?
Please, call me Professor.
We think you have potential capabilities.
What kind of capabilities?
the ability for your body to process fission and fusion.
And you can harness excess energy and turn it into these massive nuclear blasts.
And you can fly.
So you're saying you can do all this?
Only during times of convergence with a willing partner.
No, this is crazy.
No, Jax, this is your chance to right the wrong that was done to you.
Yeah, sorry, you got the wrong guy.
I do n't want nothing to do with this.
Wait a second, we are giving you the chance to be a superhero, and you're gonna say no that quickly?
Yeah, not my kind of thing.
Look, I saw your test scores, Jax.
Your grades were good enough to get into college, but you did n't go.
Is this the type of guy you are?
One setback and you fold?
Well, then maybe you're not the guy for us anyway.
Maybe this just was n't meant to be.
Cait, come on, I mean,
Jax could be our last chance at saving Professor Stein.
He said no to being a superhero.
I mean, you did n't say no when you had the chance.
Chance to have superpowers?
It took me a long time to figure out this whole hero thing.
Exactly, which is why we need someone who wants to do this.
We have to try again.
Not even a land shark, Ma'am.
Well, thanks for testing it for me.
I do n't know, probably file it under "never gonna happen."
I have another case anyway.
Oh, anything I can help you with?
No, no, no, no, Detective said definitely n- not.
Is everything all good?
I do n't know, you're just acting kind of different.
I'm the same old P. Spivot, you know?
What... actually, I have to go, but thank you so much for testing this, and I'll see you.
No, I'm... just had hell of a day.
Iris's mother, she told me she was dying.
Yeah, and I know Francine.
She's telling the truth about this.
Patty said you that you do n't want me on some case that she's on with you.
I was checking out a lead.
I'll let you know.
What is up with you and my partner, anyway?
Bar, you ca n't take your eyes off that girl.
I do n't know what you want me to tell you.
I mean, she's great, you know.
She's adorable and funny and we have a lot in common, but...
"But, um."
She's not Iris, I guess.
You've known Iris since you were ten.
You've been in love with her since forever.
I mean, you two are friends now, but she was your first love.
You're never gonna feel the same about anybody else, but you ca n't let that stop you from exploring something new.
And in happier news, remember Flash Day, the downtown celebration to honor Central City's one and only superhero?
Well, just weeks...
Hewitt, you have those nucleosome results?
I told you I needed them tonight.
And I'm telling you you'll have them tomorrow.
You know, I know you think you're smarter than everyone here, Hewitt, but I'm sick of you not doing your job, your not showing up.
If I have any more trouble from you, you're done here.
What, you're gonna take the test away and give it to another lab rat of yours?
You're gonna report me to the board?
Or maybe you're thinking of firing me?
I'd like to see you try!
Now get the hell out of my lab!
What's being described as a "spontaneous energy malfunction" erupted last night at Eikmeier Technologies.
Wanted for questioning is scientist Henry Hewitt.
Hewitt's dormant abilities must have been triggered when we attempted the merger.
This could be catastrophic.
If his powers are anything like mine, he requires a grounding mechanism to stabilize his volatility. Otherwise...
Yeah, he's gonna pop his top, and he's got a long history of violence, according to his police record.
I did n't find a police record.
Yeah, of course not, it was sealed, but guess what, ya boy hacked in and... hold on, wait for it.
One count battery, two counts aggravated assault, court - ordered anger management therapy.
He seemed like such a nice guy.
He even knew your Hudson nerd song.
Whoa, you okay?
It appears Mr. Hewitt's stability is n't the only one in question.
I think I need to lie down.
Yeah, I'll come with you.
Professor Stein is getting worse.
And Hewitt's like this because of me.
And now Jefferson Jackson will never come back because of what I said.
I just did n't believe that he has what it takes.
Sometimes, great possibilities are right in front of us, and we do n't see them, because we choose not to.
I think that we need to be open to exploring something new.
I just do n't think I can see her, Dad.
But you and me need to be crystal clear about this, Iris.
If you want to have a relationship with Francine, it's okay with me.
You do n't have to protect me.
I'm a grown man and I've dealt with these feelings a long time ago.
So you... you just believe her?
She's done some bad things in her life, but she would n't lie about this.
Dad, she shows up out of nowhere, and only says that she's dying after I told her to stay away.
Look, she did n't come to Central City to see me.
She came because of you.
I just wanted you to know everything so you can make the best decision for yourself.
I mean, she is still your mother.
Either way, whatever you decide, just know, I got your back.
Let me guess, you do n't got car troubles.
I came to apologize.
I'm sorry for what I said.
Look, we could really use your help to save Professor Stein.
My husband, Ronnie, he used to be Professor Stein's other half.
He actually helped build the Particle Accelerator, and when it exploded, he was affected by it too.
Ironically, that's how he got the chance to show the world what he was truly capable of.
Wait, he was the guy that flew into the black hole?
He was a hero.
You can be one too.
I never wanted to be a hero.
What I wanted was to go to college, but we could n't afford it.
Football was my way in, until that got taken from me.
I believe you were meant to be a hero.
I've been looking for you, Dr. Snow.
Hey, look, man, we're...
You did this to me!
But it's not what you promised, is it?
Oh, good, you're here.
This thing, it ran out, like, 30 minutes ago.
His temperature is 142 degrees and rising fast.
He's going into rapid oxidation.
We need to find a coolant.
I think it's too late for that.
I'll do it.
I'll merge with him.
You said this is a chance for me to be a part of something bigger than myself, to help people.
Once you merge, there's no going back on this.
And you said I could fly, right?
So what do I do?
- Clarissa, five more minutes.
No, Professor, you have to get up.
- Jax is here.
- Here, grab onto me.
You came back, Jefferson, thank you.
Well, like my coach always said,
"Out of yourself and into the team."
So, how's this work?
Okay, all you're gonna do is touch him.
How will I know?
Oh, so I get Grey as my copilot.
Did no one ever inform you of that fringe benefit?
So when do we get to take this for a test spin?
It looks like Hewitt's re-charging at Central City High School's football stadium.
Wait, that was where I got hurt.
Cisco, cut the power to the field so he ca n't draw anymore energy.
You need to stop!
This is not who you are!
You chose him over me?
I deserve the Firestorm Matrix!
Calm down, Jefferson, focus.
Use your natural athleticism to gain control.
I was a quarterback.
I know how to take a hit.
Hey, guys, cutting the power did n't work.
It's like the more we anger him, the stronger he gets.
That's it, it's like one of those, controlled fusion devices.
Yes, exactly, and the more powerful they become, the more unstable they become.
Barry, make him angry, and he'll blow his fuse.
You up for a little game of "catch me if you can?"
Hey, Hewitt, over here!
Do you need a hug, Doctor?
Come on, Hewitt, give me your best shot!
Is that all you got, Hewitt?
Not bad for your first go at this.
Well, I had a great coach to help me through it.
Is n't that right, Grey?
Despite my initial reservations, we make a pretty fantastic team.
Welcome aboard, Firestorm.
Thank you for coming.
You have no idea what this means to me.
My dad told me you were sick.
You know, I was n't sure that I could believe you, so I did some checking.
Turns out you're telling the truth.
I would never lie to you about something so big.
Cause I was actually thinking that I could give you another chance after hearing that news.
But you're still lying, still keeping secrets.
I'm an investigative reporter, Francine.
I uncover things that people want to keep hidden, like having a son.
He was born eight months after you left Central City.
Who's the father, Francine?
Is it my dad?
Do I have a brother?
I do n't want to know.
I want you to leave.
You stay away from me, and you stay away from my father.
If he finds out that he might have a son that grew up without even knowing him, it would crush him.
And how is Mr. Hewitt?
Seems like that last burst of energy has burnt him out.
Our Tokamak's gone dark.
Yeah, we're just gonna keep him safe and sound in the pipeline till he decides to keep quiet about all this.
So you're gonna meet up with Clarissa?
We're meeting in Pittsburgh in three days.
A colleague of mine was monumental in helping train Ronald and me.
She's graciously offered to help the two of us as well.
How's she gonna help us?
Well, there were many aspects of our abilities that we never quite achieved.
Hopefully now, we can fully realize that potential.
Oh, my dearest Dr. Snow.
Ronald may be lost to us, but he will never be forgotten.
Speaking of... this was Ronnie's.
He always used it to find his way back home.
I want you to have it.
You know, this whole thing is strange, being 50% of someone.
Yeah, but you're 100% a hero.
I went ahead and recalibrated the splicer so the merging should be even smoother now.
If I may offer a bit of parting advice.
Cisco, I know you're scared, but this ability you have is a gift, not a curse.
It's natural to be apprehensive about the unknown, but look at Jefferson.
He took a leap, and it changed his life for the better.
The very thing that makes you different is what makes you special.
Are you ready, Jefferson?
That was one hell of a leap of faith that kid took, merging with Professor Stein.
There's a lesson in there somewhere for you.
Things are n't always what they seem.
Our fears can play tricks on us, making us afraid to change course, afraid to move on, but usually, hidden behind our fears are second chances waiting to be seized...
And these opportunities do n't come around every day, so when they do, we have to be brave, take a chance, and grab them while we can.
Oh, my God, it's real.
your fins in the air!
The fence keeps bending in like that, those walkers are coming over it.
The drugs are the same we need.
Everything on the list.
I ca n't let you do this.
There are people in there suffering.
Did you kill Karen and David?
I wo n't have you there.
You're gonna survive out here.
We're trying to help.
We're two members short.
I think we should make some new rules before they get back.
I hereby declare we have spaghetti Tuesdays every Wednesday.
First we have to find some spaghetti.
You okay to take over?
Every five to six seconds, squeeze.
You start feeling lightheaded, grab somebody else to take over.
We'll take it in shifts.
How long will that keep him alive?
Help me get him on this.
- How are we gonna get his body down the stairs, across the cell block and through those doors without anyone noticing?
If that happens -- if -- you're gonna help me.
And what if I'm gone?
Shut up and help me get him on this.
What are you doing?
We're taking Mr. Jacobson to a quieter place.
Go get my copy of "Tom Sawyer" from my room.
We all got jobs to do.
- That one's yours.
- I wo n't finish it.
And drink some tea.
There was one late last night.
People do n't need to see it.
I do n't want them to.
He said he would meet me.
- If you need help, I can help you.
I was just keeping him occupied.
I can come in there and help you.
Daddy, you look so tired.
They could return any minute now.
It's hard in here.
But we're holding it together.
Just hold it together a little longer.
I love you, too.
Thank you for stopping her.
We need someone out there taking care of things.
If she saw me, could n't keep her out.
I know you did n't want to lie to her.
I'm almost done down here.
Why do n't you go lie down?
Daryl's not back yet. Rick.
She killed Karen and David.
She was trying to stop it from spreading.
Tyreese is gonna be back here soon, so I did n't think she should be here.
I'll tell your dad.
Do n't tell anyone else yet.
Would you have brought her back?
- She said she did it?
Then you were right to send her away.
I do n't know if I could have.
You've done harder things.
We do n't get to anymore.
- We need to do something.
I was gonna ask you that.
- We're fine.
- No one's sick?
You did n't have to do anything?
Found some food on the run.
Have everybody brush their teeth after.
- Can we come out soon?
Dad, I was around you when you were in the middle of it.
And I was around Patrick.
I can help you.
Thanks, but I need you to stay here.
But, Dad, you ca n't keep me from it.
From what always happens.
But I think it's my job to try.
Doctors make the worst patients.
Not everyone gets to live.
End stage is a point that no one comes back from or they -- or they ca n't.
That's where I am.
I made some more IVs.
If you're not ready to lose one, you're gonna lose them all.
It's like turning off a light -- it'll happen one after the other.
And they do n't just die.
Get back in bed now.
We're not that bad off.
When we are, it'll be too late.
You have a chance.
This is it after this.
I'm not giving up on anyone.
Just make sure everyone's doors are shut.
Drink the tea I left you.
Go on, get back in your cells.
Let's get him on this.
Can you make it to your cell?
We're burning them behind the blocks.
That's what it's come to.
I talked to him yesterday about Steinbeck.
He told me a quote.
"A sad soul can kill quicker than a germ."
That's exactly why I did n't want them all to see what happens. I know they know, but I did n't want them to see it right now.
They see you keep going.
Even after all the choices keep getting taken away.
Not seeing things for how they were?
You just caught a break.
I still think there's a plan.
I still believe there's a reason.
You think it's all a test?
I need to talk to you about Carol.
You know how to fight.
I just talked to your dad.
He looks good, all things considered.
If I thought I could help.
You do n't think I can help?
I'm just glad you're out here with me.
Being a hero takes a lot out of you.
I thought you were an idiot to come in here.
I ca n't tell if that's a compliment.
I do n't know what I'm saying.
I must have hit my head.
I do n't believe in magic or luck.
But I do n't know if I'd be here right now if you were n't so damn stupid.
I'm gonna take that as a compliment.
I do n't want to leave him in case he wakes up.
Just let him sleep.
Everyone stay in your cells.
We need to keep it standing.
- You ca n't do this alone.
Just a little more.
- I called him nice.
He did n't scratch Glenn.
I thought maybe he listens.
If things were going bad, we would have heard more shots.
Maggie would have gotten us.
We have to do this.
- I got it.
- Let me help.
Dad, what do we do?
Maybe I could back the bus up against the fence.
Magazine goes in here.
Make sure it latches.
Pull back the operating rod and rounds feed up.
Keep squeezing the trigger for rapid fire, okay?
- You shoot or you run.
You could hit the bag.
We need it for Glenn.
- Where is he?
He's turning blue!
- Roll him on his back.
Hold his arms down.
You know how this works.
Stay with us. stay with us.
You're gonna be okay.
I did n't want you in here.
I told you to stay put.
I hope so, honey.
Need some help with that?
You did n't wake me up.
I thought I'd let you sleep in.
- I should help.
- How's Glenn doing?
- He made it through the night.
He's breathing on his own now.
Maggie and Bob are with him.
He seems stable enough for me to get some air.
- How about Carol?
She up in A block with Lizzy?
Talk to Rick about her.
You want to come?
Tell them you know me, I'm not a witch!
If you would save your souls from perdition... repent now and confess your sins.
Did You signed a pact with Lucifer?
I signed a pact.
You gonna burn in hell.
Your soul, child.
Your soul will be spared.
But the body must be consigned to God for absolution.
The bodies, they must be pulled up.
Today you are truly blessed.
Today, you fight for God himself.
Today, you're holy warriors, baptized in the blood of our unholy enemies!
Look to the rabble down there, Behmen.
Just waiting to meet the Lord.
I pity any man whose last face they see is yours, Felson.
Whomever slays the most men drinks for free.
But if we divide them evenly, who will buy tonight's drinks?
Do not yield until every enemy of God has fallen!
Being his friend is not so easy either!
They are godless people!
They sinned against God and against his only son, Jesus Christ!
They must be punished.
Do not fail him!
Thousands lost souls for the fires of Hell!
- You call this glorious?
- Murdering women and children?
- Know your place, knight.
- You pledge your life for the cause.
I am a herald of God in this world.
- His voice rings ever in my ears.
I am the voice of the Church!
Bathed in truth and blameless in light of my Lord.
You're no more than a drop of blood on his hands!
Who's going stop us?
. Sheep roaming free and no shepherd in sight.
- Did they jumped the fence?
We have been walking all day and have n't passed a soul.
Keep your souls, let me find a chicken.
What happened to them?
We've seen much death you and I. Some deserved, some not.
But what is one do, to deserve a death like that?
We might be recognized.
- We should go around, Behmen.
The horses wo n't carry us They're farm animals.
Heavenly Father, accept the pain and suffering we restore upon ourselves.
Find the need in your heart to free us!
- What madness is this?
Pestilence over all the land.
- Is there no cure?
How long has it been so?
Three years and a season.
- How many dead?
- Some say as many as three in four.
With my own hands, I've buried two children and the wife who bore them.
But how is it you do n't know this?
We've only recently returned.
Two of my finest.
Felson, this way.
They saw my sword's crest.
I told we should've gone around.
Remove the hood and the mask.
I hope we are on our way to dinner.
Pardon me, your Eminence.
What is it, Debelzaq?
This is the knight's sword.
I am Behmen of Blybrook.
And your comrade, Felson.
Your names are known to me.
The plague is everywhere.
It's a curse called up from hell.
Brought upon us by the Black Witch.
I myself heard the confession.
The witch must be taken to the abbey of Severak... where the Monks possess the last copy of an ancient book... the rituals that will destroy the witch's powers... and end the plague.
What is this to do with us?
Our ranks have been decimated.
You must deliver her.
My best knight, Eckhart, has already pledged his services. As has our priest Debelzaq.
I ask the same of you.
Will you serve the Church, once more?
- Have you been released from this vow?
- My vow is to God.
Not the men who murder in his name.
You know the penalty for desertion.
I ask you again, Behmen of Blybrook.
Do you serve God and the Church?
I serve the Church no more.
What they do with deserters anyway?
If I have any say in the matter, I prefer hanging.
That is not what I see.
The priest said she confessed.
We both know the Church can be most...
I am sorry I put you into this Felson.
Ah, as dungeons go, this one is not so bad.
We spent nights in much worse places than this.
That would be you.
"I serve the Church no more"
Did you see the priest's face?
They sinned against God and against his only son, Jesus Christ!
They must be punished!
You want to speak with the Cardinal?
- This is not for your Church.
And we will need our weapons returned.
And all charges dismissed.
The distance is nearly 400 leagues.
That's roughly six days travel.
You would lead us through here?
That is the most direct route, yes.
This forest is called Wormwood.
Men have lost their way there, never to be seen again.
Tell me, Priest, have you ever made the journey yourself?
These are the best maps in the land.
But we would do better to have a guide.
You know, someone who has traveled from here to there. A tax collector, perhaps a merchant?
What can I do for you gentlemen?
I am Hagamar, but I never swindled anyone.
I sold relics. Genuine relics.
Where did sell your trinkets?
I have happy customers from here to Prague.
Yes. The monks.
I sold them the tail of an ass, ridden in the flight from Egypt.
- At a bargain, I am sure.
- Then you know the way to the abbey.
Like the back of my hand.
I'd happy to draw you a map, only...
The bailiff has prepared to pardon you.
You serve as our guide to Severak.
If I were to release you however, and you attempt to flee...
Such thoughts are beneath you Sir.
Do we understand each other?
The witch is unconscious.
She was given a powerful sedative in her food last night
We will be removing the witch for transport.
She's just a girl.
Do n't be deceived.
The sooner we get her to Severak, the better.
What did you think we are going to Severak, to sell trinkets?
You brought the wrath of good upon us!
Take the witch out of our land.
She is watching me.
Put your mind on something else.
She is trying to frighten you.
How did you come upon this girl?
Muttering strange things, words no one can understand.
- This makes her a witch?
And within a fortnight of her arrival, the plague had swept over us.
It was the same for every town she passed.
There no talk of such a girl passing through my village...
Yet the plague came.
She is stronger than she looks.
Do you believe she is a witch?
But you felt her strength, would you say it was that of a girl?
I have seen girls destroy men without lifting a finger.
How many times do we need to go over this? We were in France!
And things she did in the bed chamber.
She gave me so much in return.
You know we're being followed.
Let's give him a royal welcome.
Why you're following us?
I asked you a question boy.
My name is Kay.
My father was a knight.
Yuran Wolenbar. He also fought at Ambrose. Perhaps you've heard his name.
I want to come with you to Severak.
In exchange for which, I ask your word that you will vouch for me upon our return... so that I may be knighted.
I feel safer already.
I would have you know, I have been written in the lists twice and won flags for valor.
This is n't a tournament, boy. Go back to your mother.
And I do n't need your permission to travel it.
Give the lad a chance to retract the remark.
- That I can not.
I'm going to teach this one some manners.
Not bad for an altar boy.
What the devil was that?
Stand and fight like a man, you little jackrabbit.
Perhaps you can be of service.
I heard what the Cardinal said, about your heroism in the Crusades.
I'd have gone too, but I was too young.
Well tell me about it, where did you enlist?
It was the part about sin that perked young Felson's interest.
"Would they forgive adultery?"
"Yes, for a two year pledge".
So Felson mulls it over and says to the priest.
I brought you some food...
You're not like the others.
This place you're taking me... What will happen to me there?
Your innocence or guilt will be decided
There was a girl in my village who was suspected of being a witch.
They put stones in her pockets and cast her into the lake.
If she drowned, they would have known she was human.
But she did n't.
They called it proof of magic and burned her at the stake.
Nothing of the kind will happen to you.
You will be given a fair trial.
You have my word on that.
Did she said anything?
- Why do you ask?
- I only mean to caution you.
The witch is a deceiver.
She'll turn one man against another.
Who is to guard the wagon?
The girl is caged.
There will be plenty of time between here and Severak.
I came to relieve you.
You're not tired?
I do n't sleep much these days.
I was thinking about how much the girl reminds me of my daughter.
Her name was Mila.
Tell me, Father...
But has he not also given his word end to the plague?
What do you suggesting?
No, our responsibility is to deliver her for trial.
The monks will decide her fate.
The monks will decide her fate, and I will not be a party to this.
Nor will the others, hopefully when they have heard what I have to say.
Please do n't leave me alone with him.
How did she escape?
She took the key from around my neck.
Which way did she go?
Kay and Eckhart that way.
- Father, where are you?
- Do n't run away!
He came running out of no where.
Why did n't he stopped?
Why did n't he see me?
He looked me in the eye, but he did n't see me.
She called me Mila.
I had to run, I had no choice.
I could n't let him touch me again.
For he was a soldier of the cross and fought in thy name. And in the name of thy only Son, Jesus Christ.
And thus did he die for the glory of God.
Would anyone care to offer some words?
Let his sacrifice, not be in vain.
Behmen, I must speak with you
- What is it now, Priest?
- You must warn the others be careful in her presence.
It was the witch killed Eckhart.
You heard what Kay said.
his mind was not his own.
She overheard us talking of his daughter.
What exactly are you suggesting?
She sees the weakness that lies in our hearts.
And once she sees that, she will use against us.
I am truly grateful for your help.
A man like you could never stand to see a young girl come to any harm.
Debelzaq believes you're to blame for Eckhart death.
After what he did to me?
I had no reason to harm Eckhart He was nothing but kind to me.
He told me, I look like his daughter.
I can see his death weighs heavy on your mind.
Allow me to ease your pain.
Some good deeds can done even from behind bars.
Kay, remember this, it was not your fault.
It was the witch. No one else.
It was mine. I killed him.
You call that a bridge?
Last time I saw it Was eight or nine years ago.
I remember it differently.
Tis our reward for taking a swindler as our guide.
I told you, I am not a swindler
How we are supposed to get across this rotting timber.
You're blaming me for the bridge?
You're the one...
Take everything off the wagon.
Bring the horses across, one by one.
It will be on my count of three.
Ca n't hold out much longer!
Hagamar, hitch a rope to the horses, and we'll use them to pull the wagon.
If you let me out, it'll be lighter.
Please, I can help.
I've saved your ass a hundred times. Have a little faith!
It would be a shame if he bled to death.
Hagamar, where are we?
Like a veil before my eyes.
We have n't strayed from the path, have we?
I can barely see my own hand in front of my face.
The only reason you're around is because you claimed you knew the way.
I know the way, I just ca n't see the way.
Wait for the fog to pass.
Kay told me what happened on the bridge.
He said you saved his life.
We believe what we want to believe.
Do you believe I am a witch, Behmen?
You are not afraid of me, are you?
Not sure if it's the fog, the altitude...
It's unsettling, even for a knight.
Let alone a spineless scoundrel like myself.
That is not what I meant.
Behmen, how many more are going to die before we reach Severak?
- None, if I can help it.
Forgive me if I seem reluctant to put my life in your hands.
But I have a better solution.
We tell whose back in Molbrow, she tried to escape.
What can we do? We had no choice.
And who will be the wiser?
Did you hear that?
- Get the horses, I'll take the wagon.
Behmen, what are you doing?
- He's doing what comes naturally, killing the innocent.
No one grieves for that more than I.
Then step aside, or this arrow will be yours!
If we falter now, those lives would have been lost in vain.
And what are four lives, compared with the thousands more that will be lost... if this plague is not ended.
I know, there may be no room in your heart for God, Behmen.
But in my heart, I know he will not abandon us.
No man has spilt more blood in God's name than I.
A benevolent God... Well there such things as men!
If you kill her, you will not have God to blame.
The end is in site.
We've come a long way, Behmen.
Crossed oceans, deserts.
Seen things few men have seen.
When this is over, I think I'd like see the valley where I was born.
I have no such yearnings for home.
I will show you my home and we will sit in the hall where my forefathers sat and drink ale.
And tell tales, few men have lived to tell.
And fewer still will believe!
At this time, they should be in Vespers.
My brothers, forgive the intrusion, but we have traveled far.
He would not abandon us.
God would not abandon us.
We must go, there is no hope here.
These men were our hope.
We are in God's hands now.
Prayer is our only salvation.
The book of which the Cardinal spoke.
Within this pages is said to be all the rituals, prayers, and incantations... used by holy men, throughout the ages... to defend against the forces of evil.
Can... you perform the ritual?
Is this the fair trial you promised me, Behmen?
You sealed your own fate.
That this woman stands accused of witchcraft.
That she has admitted to calling up a plague against all mankind.
But I must confess...
I have deceived you...
You think you can save yourself by recanting, but you're wrong.
Speak the truth now before God!
Do not speak to me of the truth, you hypocrite.
For centuries you and your ilk have been burning, hanging, crucifying... anyone who stood in their way.
In truth, I should thank you.
All you needed was a child to save.
Did you truly think that saving one ragged waif, would change anything?
Your sins are legend.
How many innocent have fallen beneath that very blade?
They sinned against God and against his only son, Jesus Christ!
They must be punished!
We're gonna need more holy water.
Are we going in there to defeat the demon, or to save the girl?
- This as far as you go, Kay.
This is not your battle.
I took a vow to join your cause.
I release you from your vow.
There is no shame in it.
Honor is not a thing to be dismissed or forgotten.
A vow must be fulfilled, else it is no vow at all.
Grant me courage O Lord.
- For I'm thy servant.
- And guard me with strength unto battle...
- That I may crush thy enemies...
- As dust before the wind.
I know in my heart, I have not earned this.
The demon could've escaped anytime.
Why did it wait until we reach Severak?
Perhaps escape was n't it's purpose.
It wants to be here.
Debelzaq, you said Eckhart tried to free her.
And it killed him, and Hagamar too.
The sooner we get her to Severak, the better.
Everything it's done, has led us here.
Why would a dying monk do this to himself?
Why would he tie himself to a desk?
It's a passage from Book of Solomon.
There are more over here.
They were copying it.
To spread the wisdom of Solomon to all the corners of the earth, that the pious might be armed.
It wants the book!
That's why the demon deceived us into believing the girl was a witch.
It knew that a witch would be brought to those who possess the Book of Solomon.
If the book would've fall into the demon's hands, we would face an endless darkness.
It's our last defence.
I sure thank all of you.
You sacrificed so much to deliver me here. And now you've brought me the book.
You have no idea how bad that cursed book has tormented me over the centuries.
I destroyed the others.
This is the last one.
You'll be buying tonight my friend.
To owe so much to someone I've never even knew.
Say what is within your heart.
My name is Anna.
I owe you my life.
So the plague passed and life returned to the land.
There are many who say the plague was nothing but a pestilence that finally broke.
Like the passing of a fever.
They do n't know the darkness that almost was.
I will tell their story.
One source suggests that Danny Rand may have been using his own business to smuggle millions of dollars of illegal drugs.
the New York DEA has placed him at the top of their list of most wanted fugitives.
This is Thembi Wallace reporting from Downtown Manhattan.
Why do n't you get it washed for me?
I know for a fact that the charges against Danny are false.
you seemed very much on the anti-Danny track.
I want to help him.
Danny made a poor decision when he attacked the DEA agents.
His life is in danger.
I have n't had any contact with him.
perhaps you could tell me who would want to set him up in this way?
I see you've aged reasonably well.
You have been faking your death for all these years?
That is fraud on the highest level.
Would you mind excusing us?
I need to speak with my son.
Stepping out in public?
The time is now.
I did n't even know that was there.
the world thinks you're dead.
How are you going to explain what happened?
I've had 13 years to plan this out.
I spin'em a tale about the art of gene therapy and the tremendous advances we've made in cryotherapy.
the board's gonna welcome me back with open arms.
this is your last chance to come on board.
it's just me and Joy running this company.
Danny is just a drug - smuggling fugitive from the law.
I think we both know that's not true.
Now we'll get rich both ends.
- You owe Danny.
He freed you from the Hand.
I'll send flowers to his funeral.
It's not the best time to sneak up on me.
At least it's a cute picture.
They think you were using Rand as a cover.
I shut down Gao's operation.
I got the drugs out of Rand.
I do n't care what it says.
I just want to know why Harold's doing this.
You do n't wanna start down that rabbit hole.
I'm such a jerk.
I have n't even asked how you're doing.
It's all kind of overwhelming.
Running from the DEA's been a nice distraction.
Glad I could help.
Every second we spend running is a second we should be fighting back.
What are we supposed to do? figure out a way to refute it.
I need to get in touch with Hogarth.
But maybe we should n't contact her directly.
We do n't know where the DEA's eyes are.
We need a messenger.
I was asked to give you something.
A client needs you.
$5 will get you exactly two seconds of my time.
I can take you to him.
Look who I found.
Huh. I'm obliged to tell you to turn yourself in.
You really think that's a good idea?
You're a billionaire facing federal drug charges.
You might as well have the words "Flight Risk" stamped on your forehead.
and you will end up in a jail cell for 6 to 12 months minimum before this even goes to trial.
did you find out what evidence the DEA has against Danny?
Another fugitive from the law.
The DEA considers both of you armed and dangerous.
So you have some problems of your own to focus on.
Just put her on my tab.
this is what they've given me.
These are from the Hand tablet.
They've been changed.
It must've been Harold Meachum.
You know that he's alive then?
I just saw him.
Ward tried to warn me that Harold was gonna call the DEA on me.
I just wonder why he would be
- faking his death for all these years.
- He did n't fake it.
Maybe prove that the documents were forged.
I gave it to Harold.
Back when I was stupid enough to think we were on the same side.
Is there anything else we can do?
the best I can do is beg for a plea deal.
And the third option?
Those documents are digital.
There's a very good chance that they've been copied somewhere.
Can you think of anyone who might have them?
The one person I trust even less than Harold.
There's at least 50 teenagers living in there.
Silent is the last thing it should be.
You think it's deserted?
Where would they go?
There's so much I do n't know.
They left you here?
There are metal screens on those windows.
You could have escaped.
I've been looking forward to this.
Why should I tell you anything?
I'll cut off your head and feed it to the rats.
That does not sound pleasant.
I need access to everything that was on the tablet I took from you.
I purged all that information from my computers.
- There are no other copies?
I have never lied to him.
Can you say the same?
Tell me what I need to know.
It's no mystery why you're such a poor Iron Fist.
You do n't understand your own path.
- And what should I be guilty of?
- The death of your parents.
I was just a kid.
Child touched by fire. Is n't that how it goes?
And now that child has grown up.
Much easier to burn it in the flames of anger.
You think you're so clever with these little mind games.
You wanted someone to pay for the death of your mother and father.
We're wasting our time here.
If what you're saying is true then why have n't I killed you already?
Because you know I did n't kill your parents.
Why would I have gone to such trouble to hide it with a plane crash?
It was someone much more treacherous than I, as I thought it would draw too much unwanted attention.
She is playing mind games.
She's trying to get you on her side.
The side of truth and honesty.
Who else would kill my parents?
Stop thinking like a child.
Who would benefit most from the death of the Rand family?
- Are you sure?
Harold was my father's best friend. He would never...
He seems to have no problem hurting you now.
You were in the plane as well.
He set up our heroin operation in China.
Harold feared that he would ruin everything.
I still remember the moment when he came to me and asked for poison.
He seemed very enthused by the idea.
You will only gain the strength of a real Iron Fist after you have killed Harold.
You must rid yourself of this anger.
Danny Rand. and it will lead you to fulfill your destiny as the true Iron Fist.
Those who walk through that door are never heard from again.
Let's hope your minions find you before you rot.
There are no locks strong enough to imprison the truth.
He's been lying to me.
I'm so sorry.
He's not gonna get away with this.
I'll help you.
I'll do whatever I can.
That's all we need to prove your innocence.
Anything else we leave to the cops.
He's gonna pay for what he's done.
He's gonna go to prison.
I used to think my mom was still alive.
Out there waiting for me to come and find her.
Do you know how crazy that is?
I kept trying to escape.
This howling wind.
But there was no way out.
you're not the first friend of mine with special powers.
I can win any fight!
You know you were n't given this gift so that you could commit murder.
You ca n't kill Harold.
I think that if you kill Harold out of your own vengeance... it'll corrupt your chi.
You'll never be the Iron Fist you're meant to be.
Which is why I have to kill Harold for you.
Is there a version of this where we do n't kill someone?
How do we get the tablet?
You're looking better.
And I do n't blame you.
I'm sorry about what happened.
I'm sorry that you got hurt.
I swear I was trying to protect you.
Who said I needed protecting?
Every second you spend with him could be your last.
Do you hear how crazy you sound?
Dad has been held prisoner for 13 years.
of course he's acting a little off.
I watched him go at two dead men with a claw hammer.
I ca n't even trust a word you say.
That was Dad's decision.
But you went along with it.
What about the drug abuse?
Who forced you to lie about that?
- I'm not lying about Dad.
I ca n't do this anymore.
You need to get yourself some help.
And whatever your problem is with Dad, it's your problem.
- I'd like you to leave now.
I'm not going anywhere until you understand why I did what I did last night.
Just get rid of him.
There are armed bodyguards posted outside the building.
I'm helping me.
I want Dad put away just as much as you do.
I seriously doubt that.
You think your being on the run for one day can compare to my lifetime of abuse?
He killed my parents.
He caused my plane to crash.
Who are your new friends?
what are you doing here?
I had to get out of there.
I'm no fan of hospitals myself.
I'll get the car to run you home.
I do n't want to go home.
Ward said I could find you here.
I'll drop by later.
That place opened up last year.
I think you need a little rest.
Why did you frame Danny?
I saw everything that you had on the Hand's drug operation.
I know how much Danny means to you.
So I withheld certain documents.
I'm sorry if that was the wrong decision.
Show them to me now.
I gave everything to the DEA.
you saw how familiar Danny was with those people from the Hand.
He's been working with them the whole time.
He's been selling drugs to them from our company.
You set him up.
Did Danny tell you that?
I have n't seen him.
He's just like he did with Ward.
He wo n't stop until he destroys our family.
Then look me in the eye and tell me you did n't do it.
I swear on my life I did n't do that.
Do n't touch me.
do n't let him beat us.
You're stronger than that.
everyone knows what they're doing?
You're gonna need this.
As much as Hogarth would give me.
It ca n't be tonight.
but it's not just the guards outside.
Dad has his own armed guards upstairs.
Why do you always make me do things like that?
- Sounds like Harold found out.
Then we get out of here.
the plan stays the same.
We ca n't just leave Ward up there.
We ca n't wait for the police.
Let's not pretend that you care about Ward when we know what this is really about for you.
I'm going in there.
Let's just think about this.
- He's gonna get himself killed.
- I ca n't let him do this alone.
we stick to the plan.
Just get the tablet!
Tell me you're not gonna try to kill Harold!
How much for your cart?
- Only thing I'm selling is peanuts.
I'll go around the back.
You looking for me?
Just got a call from our guards downstairs.
Danny Rand is here.
Let's get ready for him.
I hope like hell you know what you're doing.
- They're on the roof.
- He is gonna get himself killed.
Last time I was up here was with your father.
Building was n't even open yet.
We came up here and looked down at New York.
We had the world at our feet.
We were standing on that little ledge over there.
And here's the funny part.
I had this overwhelming urge to push Wendell over.
He was my friend.
Just one of those things.
That I did n't kill Wendell then, before you were even born.
you destroyed my family!
All I wanted was to have my family beside me.
vengeance is the only thing I'm interested in.
you're just another screwed up little kid who wo n't go where I go.
It's my choice!
but you wo n't.
That's why you're gonna die.
Better that than to live like you.
Hated by those who should love you no matter what.
It's time to face it!
You will only gain the strength of a real Iron Fist after you have killed Harold.
You must rid yourself of this anger.
Give your Uncle Harold a hug.
I've been here before.
Come out of the darkness so I can see you.
The battle is won.
I've wasted too many years hating whatever it is you are.
Thank you for being here.
And I did n't want to do this alone.
Any news from Joy?
I was told I'd find you here.
We could have met you at the office.
I always enjoy a good cremation.
I just got off the phone with the agent in charge of the New York DEA.
In light of the fact that you were set up and are going to be making a very generous contribution including the assault against their officers.
You are a free man.
You should come back to Rand.
I'm not really a good businessman.
I'm gonna miss Dad.
Who will I blame for my weaknesses, my unhappiness?
I've spent my whole life feeling like my parents were watching over me.
I really did n't realize there was going to be so much emotional honesty.
Let's do this.
Does n't look as fancy as last time.
I'm trying to go beyond what my father taught me.
I see you're keeping up your training.
She's my only student left.
you got a gift for working with troubled kids.
I'm pretty sure I could get Rand to sort out some kind of scholarship or something.
but I need time to think about it.
I need to explain to Lei Kung why I left.
I also need to complete my training.
There's still so much I do n't know about being an Iron Fist.
I'm saying this as a friend but you two share a lot in common.
that's not a good thing.
I guess what I'm saying here is you're both pretty effed up and need some serious psychological help.
Lei Kung taught me that I was a powerful weapon, a flame meant to destroy our enemies.
But I keep thinking that
A light for those trapped in the darkness.
it seems the boy you knew died that day.
Becoming the Iron Fist changed him.
Is n't it true your world fell apart after his return?
I can help you with that.
I can almost smell the stew that Rabten keeps going day and night.
We should get there just in time for afternoon kung fu practice.
But I should have been here.
- You bet, Dad!
You go straight home.
No preservatives, just pure water!
Cool, clear water.
Step up, schmuck, get some dealing done.
H20, that's my go.
Do n't you understand?
You ca n't live without it.
What's a little fallout, huh?
Have a nice day!
What are you trading?
I'm looking for someone.
Are you trading or not?
He had a team of camels.
People come here to trade, make a little profit, do some business.
If you've nothing to trade, you've no business here.
- I got skills I can trade.
The brothel's full.
- I'll ask him to return what's mine.
And he'll be desperate to clear his conscience.
You're that good?
Perhaps you have something to trade after all.
24 hours of your life.
In return, you'll get back what was stolen.
Sounds like a bargain.
Leave your weapons here.
Remember, this is the vehicle that sent Detroit broke.
Where did you get these animals?
The glorious dromedary. The ship of the desert.
A warrior, Aunty.
Looking for a deal.
But he's just a raggedy man.
What did you do before this?
I was a cop, a driver.
But how the world turns.
Play something tragic, Ton Ton.
Do you know who I was?
Except on the day after, I was still alive.
This nobody had a chance to be somebody.
So much for history.
You're the first to survive the audition.
All this I built.
Where there was desert, now there's a town.
Where there was robbery, there's trade.
I'll do anything to protect it.
Today it's necessary to kill a man.
What do you pay?
I'll re-equip you... Vehicles, animals.
Fuel, if you want.
It's a generous offer.
You've got warriors, weapons.
We are dealing with subtleties here.
This is no enemy.
It's almost family.
The reasons do n't concern you, just the conditions.
First, no one knows you're working for Aunty.
You hit him, you go.
Second, it's a fair fight.
And third, it's to the death.
Who's the bunny?
It's called Underworld.
It's where Bartertown gets its energy.
Oil, natural gas?
The lights, the motors, the vehicles all run by a high - powered gas called methane.
I see a big guy giving a little guy a piggyback.
They're a unit.
They even share the same name.
The little one is called Master.
The other one is Blaster.
Together they can be very powerful.
We want to keep the brain, dump the body.
I want a closer look at him.
How do I get in there?
- It's a factory. Ask for work.
Here, free man, come help a convict.
You do n't want to end up like me.
How long are you in for?
For killing a pig?
I had to feed the kids.
Does n't worry me.
Down here life's two, three years.
Where is that bum mechanic Blackfinger?
We got a real problem.
Twelve pounds of dynamite set to blow.
It's a class job.
One mistake, it'll blow the crap out of this place.
- Think what to do!
Now... the dynamite is connected to the timing device which is connected to the switch, which I ca n't find which is connected to the battery.
- I'll disconnect the battery!
- I would n't do that.
That's my vehicle.
Me order. Me Master!
Four, three, two... For God's sake, what now?
I told you, no more embargos.
You want foot in face?
Over here, Blaster.
- What are you laying for?
No, mister, I can feel it.
The dice are rolling!
I want my camels, my vehicle, food, water, methane.
- You said a fair fight.
- What does that mean?
- As provided by law.
No jury, no appeal, no parole.
Two men enter, one man leaves.
How do I get in there?
Everybody have a good time!
That's my vehicle and I want it back!
Sounds like an order.
Aunty, two men in dispute.
These our witness, Aunty.
Two men enter, one man leaves.
Then it's your choice.
This is the truth of it.
Fighting leads to killing, and killing gets to warring.
And that was damn near the death of us all.
Look at us now, busted up and everyone talking about hard rain.
But we've learned by the dust of them all. Bartertown's learned.
Now when men get to fighting, it happens here.
Two men enter, one man leaves.
And right now, I've got two men.
Two men with a gut full of fear.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls dying time's here!
He's the ball cracker.
Get to the weapons, use them anyway you can.
I know you wo n't break the rules.
Death is listening, and will take the first man that screams.
Two men enter, one man leaves!
- You know the law!
- This is Thunderdome!
Look at his face!
It's not his fault.
Blaster, I'm sorry.
This was n't part of the deal.
You must have tasted it.
It was in your hands.
You had it all!
This place... finished!
No, little man.
We've only just begun.
Do you think I do n't know the law?
Was n't it me who wrote it?
And this man has broken the law.
And the law says, "Bust a deal, face the wheel."
Bust a deal and face the wheel.
All our lives hang by a thread.
Now we've got a man waiting for sentence.
But ai n't it the truth?
You take your chances with the law.
Justice is only a roll of the dice a flip of the coin, a turn of the wheel.
Master, do what Ironbar says.
It's him. I finded him.
It's Captain Walker.
What's his talk?
He ai n't made wordstuff.
It's a long track.
Maybe he's just listening.
Maybe he's talking, but we ai n't hearing.
You see his lips ai n't moving.
This is Delta - Fox - X - Ray.
Can you read me, Walker?
Hey, take me with you!
Can you hear me, Walker?
And who am I?
I think he be testing us.
This a testing, Walker?
You reckon we been slack?
Maybe you've been slack.
We kept it straight.
Everything marked, everything 'membered.
I be First Tracker.
Times past count I done the Tell.
But it were n't me that tumbled Walker.
So it's only right that she take the Tell.
This ai n't one body's story.
You got to listen it and 'member.
Cause what you hears today you got to tell the birthed tomorrow.
I'm looking behind us now across the count of time down the long haul, into history back.
I sees the end what were the start.
It's Pox -Eclipse, full of pain!
And out of it were birthed crackling dust and fearsome time.
It were full - on winter and Mr. Dead chasing them all.
That were Captain Walker.
He gathers up a gang, takes to the air and flies to the sky!
So they left their homes, said bidey - bye to the high - scrapers and what were left of the knowing, they left behind.
Some say the wind just stoppered.
And after the wreck some had been jumped by Mr. Dead but some had got the luck, and it leads them here.
One look and they's got the hots for it.
They word it "Planet Earth."
And they says, "We do n't need the knowing.
We can live here. "
Time counts and keeps counting.
They get so lonely for the high - scrapers and the video.
And they do pictures so they 'member all the knowing they lost.
Tomorrow - morrow Land!
The River of Light!
Then Captain Walker picked them of an age and good for a long haul.
They counted twenty, and that were them.
And from the nothing they looked back and Captain Walker hollered, "Wait, one of us will come."
"Wait, one of us will come."
And somebody did come.
We's heartful to you, Captain Walker.
We kept it straight!
Everything marked, everything 'membered!
You kept it real good.
You ai n't been slack.
That ai n't me.
- Catch the wind.
- We got to see Tomorrow - morrow Land!
There were places like these.
They were called cities.
They had lots of knowing.
They had skyscrapers videos and they had the sonic.
This Pox - Eclipse happened, and it's finished.
It is n't there anymore.
You got to understand that this is home and there's no Tomorrow Land and I ai n't Captain Walker.
We's loaded and waiting, Captain.
We got the wind up our arse, Captain.
We's pulling a leaving.
There ai n't gonna be no leavings. All that's just jerking time.
We's working it different.
Ai n't you seen nothing?
He could n't catch the wind.
There were n't no skyrafting.
There wo n't be no salvage.
This is our Tomorrow - morrow Land.
He's proof of that.
Program! All of you program.
If he ai n't Captain Walker, who is he?
He ai n't no different to us.
He slogged it on foot.
If he can get here, we can get back.
He ai n't much bigger than us.
Copilot did it. So why ca n't we?
That's the trick of it.
Do n't you 'member?
When you finded him, he were half jumped by Mr. Dead.
Nobody's saying it ai n't a hard slog.
If we wants the knowing, it ai n't an easy ride.
There ai n't no knowing!
There ai n't no skyraft and no sonic.
You slog out there to nothing!
The first place you'll find is a sleaze pit called Bartertown.
If the earth does n't swallow you up, that place will.
He's got wordstuff out his ass!
Whoever's got the juice, track with us.
I'm not Captain Walker.
I'm the guy who keeps Mr. Dead in his pocket.
And I say we're gonna stay here.
And we'll live a long time and we'll be thankful.
You got to get them back!
Scrooloose let them go.
They're in the nothing.
Come on, you got to help me!
You got to help me get them back!
He can hardly walk.
Little Finn, Mr. Skyfish, and Cusha.
They be deep in the nothing.
It makes no difference.
They'll be swallowed up by the sand.
I's coming salvage for my buddies.
We needs a hunter.
Quick, let's trek!
Is it Tomorrow - morrow Land?
It's our only chance.
Get in, we're right behind you.
Tubba, Cusha, wait up!
Head for the light.
Where are the others?
They've gone ahead.
We're looking for someone.
A little guy with the knowing of a lot of things.
What's to see, Captain?
It's him, Captain!
He's the smallest!
What use is he? Shh!
Where are you gonna run?
Where are you gonna hide?
Find the little man.
Bring him back to me... alive!
For those who took him... no mercy!
There ai n't no plan.
It's got to be!
Now repeat after me. Bonjour.
He's got the man!
Hold it, Blackfinger!
Blackfinger, let go!
I've got you now, and I'm going home!
We're gonna count to three.
Anybody moves, and they're dead meat!
I think we're all dead meat!
We're dead meat!
Which way did he go?
I warned you, Dad!
It might save your life.
Dad, you better do something!
- Kick her in the guts.
- Not gonna make it.
We have n't any choice.
Between them and us, there's not enough runway.
Ai n't we a pair raggedy man.
The years travel fast.
And time after time I've done the Tell.
Cause what you hears today, you got to tell the newborn tomorrow.
I's looking behind us now, into history back.
I sees those of us that got the luck and started the haul for home.
It lead us here and we was heartful 'cause we seen what there once was.
One look, and we knewed we'd got it straight.
Those what had gone before had knowing of things beyond our reckoning even beyond our dreaming.
And we knows now finding the trick of what's been and lost ai n't no easy ride.
But that's our track. We got to travel it.
And there ai n't nobody knows where it's gonna lead.
Still and all, every night we does the Tell so that we 'member who we was and where we came from.
But most of all we 'members the man who finded us him that came the salvage.
And we lights the city.
Not just for him but for all of them that are still out there.
Cause we knows there'll come a night when they sees the distant light and they'll be coming home.
There's a horn or something!
Half of them broke off.
They're going towards Alexandria.
I'll get the RV.
I can lead them away again.
You just get home.
I can keep you safe.
The town was overrun.
He split off with Nicholas.
He had this idea that... if he lit a fire, it would stop the walkers from coming here.
I tried to go instead.
The fire never got lit.
We had to keep going.
He said if he got stuck, he would find a way to send us a signal.
Open the gate now!
You can hear it.
Some of you saw it.
Still enough to surround us 20 deep.
Look, I know you're scared.
You have n't seen anything like this.
You have n't been through anything like this.
But we're safe for now.
The panel the truck hit seems intact.
We reinforced it just in case.
Either way, the wall's gonna hold together.
They're gonna be back.
Daryl, Abraham, Sasha, they have vehicles.
And Glenn and Nicholas are gonna walk back through the front gate after.
They know what they're doing, and we know what we need to do.
We keep noise to a minimum.
Pull our blinds at night.
Even better, keep the lights out.
We'll try to make this place as quiet as a graveyard, see if they move on.
This place is a graveyard.
The quarry broke open and those walkers were heading this way.
The plan that Rick put into place stopped that from happening.
He got half of them away.
I was out there recruiting with Daryl.
I wanted to try to get into a cannery and scavenge, and Daryl wanted to keep looking for people.
We did what I wanted... and we wound up in a trap set by those people.
And I lost my pack.
They must've followed our tracks.
Those people who attacked us... they found their way back here because of me.
There'll be more to talk about.
We do n't bury killers inside the walls.
We are n't going out there.
I ca n't even make two meals out of this.
What difference does that make if we'll be dead tomorrow?
I ca n't spend whatever time I have left watching my family starve.
I just do n't see the point.
This stuff is for everyone.
Why do n't you go make sure the gate's closed, Spencer?
But that truck outside the walls, it'd be inside if it was n't for me.
I did that, too.
If I did n't, maybe we would n't be talking right now.
Where were you, Bruce?
Doing this will start us down a road where nothing matters.
Where no one else matters.
You're going out?
The flashlights, the rebar, the rope.
You lower them off the wall a good distance apart, maybe spin them.
Just waiting for dark, right?
What happens when you twist an ankle jumping down?
You ca n't stop me.
I'm going to help you.
And I know a safer way out.
This came from the pantry.
You... you stole it?
I would n't call it that.
If they all went in and raided the pantry and everyone knew it, saw it, then that would be the end.
One person, and no one ever would know.
So, why not me?
I stopped that little run at the bank.
I deserve a reward.
Because they were right, Mom, and you know it.
You're the reason we're so screwed.
You made us this way.
We were never safe here.
But you did n't want to see that.
You did n't want us to see that.
You just wanted to dream.
What happened to Dad, to Aiden, that's all you.
Why would n't I be?
Have you seen Enid?
I think she went over the wall just before the herd came and now she's trapped out there.
What makes you think she is n't dead?
I'll go find her.
I just need your help.
- If you maybe climb up...
- I'm not helping you, Carl.
This is n't for me.
So you want to just leave her out there?
I told her to stop going over the wall, I told her there's bad people out there and that it's stupid and dangerous.
Not if you know what you're doing.
Carl, you're not going out there.
I'll tell your dad.
He'll go out there to find you, then other people will, too.
And then somebody's gonna die.
You saved my life and now I'm saving yours.
Got away from me.
Wo n't tell you you're being brave, either.
He has n't woken up.
I do n't know what the hell to do, so it does n't really matter what I'm being.
Yeah, but you're still here.
On a scale of one to 10, how bad?
I'm just checking on you.
Clueless on the floor.
You patched people up.
You're helping make things better.
I think he's gonna die.
And I'm so scared about what's happening in here that I ca n't think about what's happening out there.
And that's actually good.
And I do n't know what to do with that.
I just want him to live and for the roamers to go away.
And for a doctor to show up at the gates so I can go back to my apartment and keep reading "War and Peace."
He's not dead yet.
I do n't know about that.
You know, being afraid sucks.
I used to not want to see... the way things are.
It's not that I could n't.
I did n't want to.
If we do n't fight, we die.
I thought you said we were n't going over.
We're going under.
This leads to a sewer that was part of the old neighborhood that was here before they built this up.
It'll take us under the wall... ... and hopefully past the walkers.
I ca n't watch more names go up on that wall.
If he's alive...
He told Michonne he would've found some way to signal us if he got out.
If he's alive, he needs my help.
That's why I'm doing this.
And if he's dead, I do n't want to be waiting on him.
None of this is your fault.
I was a part of that.
And I have to live with that.
I have n't been down here since the beginning.
This ladder must've fallen a long time ago.
- On three, ready?
This could need stitches.
Aaron, just go back.
- I was just there for you.
- I could have done it.
- Daryl, Sasha, Abraham, you copy?
Can I come up?
You have n't seen it.
Enid, she, uh... she used to sneak over the walls, spend time out there.
She just wanted to.
I think she went out there after the attack.
What, she's still out there?
We do n't know where she is.
And we ca n't go out there.
I told him I'd tell you if he did.
I just thought I should tell you...
Do you know where he is now?
I saw him on the porch with Judith.
I can keep guard, if you want.
This is just about keeping an eye out for the others that are n't back, looking for a sign from Glenn.
Um... so I was thinking about what you said back at the quarry.
I need to know how to protect myself and my mom and brother.
So can you teach me how to shoot?
Yeah, being afraid sucks.
We're still too close.
I burned his last picture of him because I said I was n't gonna need it anymore.
Because I was never gonna be away from him again.
He did n't want me to go out there and I said yes.
And if I would've gone... if I was with him, maybe I could've helped him.
I do n't know if he's alive.
He would've shown me by now.
I just want to see his face.
I do n't get to know what will happen.
I wo n't get to know why it happened, what I did right or wrong.
I have to live with that.
Sam, I made you some cookies.
Could you bring them up here, please?
Why do n't you wanna come downstairs?
Well, I'm more than halfway up, so technically I'm upstairs.
You can come here and you wo n't be downstairs.
Carol said she got one of them, but she could n't find the body.
He must have been under there.
I want this place to stay standing.
You need to lead them.
They do n't need me, Rick.
When he gets back, it's worth mentioning that Aaron, Erin, works for a boy or a girl, depending on the spelling.
I'm your relief.
I volunteered to take her place.
You know, I never got a chance to say it, but... you did good with the truck, taking out the driver.
You know, if it were n't for you, this wall might not be standing right now.
I just got lucky.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
We do n't know if he's still out there.
And Daryl, Sasha, Abraham.
I wanted them back by now.
I wanted those things gone.
I just wanted to wait.
Rick, it already has.
They could still be alive.
We're not moving past that.
You heard about that?
I was n't saying there was n't a future.
There's gotta be.
Tell me there's more.
You are not the first of your kind to arrive.
We call them the Sun and the Moon.
Your mother and the Book of Leaves saved my life.
Every painful moment is part of God's plan.
Then make me a full partner in your plan.
I am taking it with me.
Now I must consider what to do with those no longer supporting my leadership.
Without him you can not enter the Vault of Heaven.
Why would the book still be in the vault?
I said she went in the vault.
I never said she left it.
Wherever Riario goes, the corpses follow.
He's ready to kill for the Book of Leaves.
What happened to you in the altar room?
What did you see?
We need to get what we came for.
And what of me?
You assisted in the ritual and I am very thankful.
I am as deserving as you both.
Yet not as trustworthy.
Are he and I really so different?
Tell me, what do you believe keeps him from stealing the book for himself?
The Sun and the Moon entered it many years ago and were never seen again.
The Abyssinian and my mother.
Maestro, you ca n't expect her to still be in the vault.
Your friends doubt the power of the Book of Leaves.
And what price do you imagine me paying?
You've proven your worth to this family.
None would dare lay a hand on you.
It's not my body I worry for.
I wonder about the bond between us.
And how it will endure.
I do care about you but I also have a reputation to maintain.
As does your husband.
I have suffered under the weight of reputation.
He came in through the roof.
We must ensure no harm has come to Giuliano's child.
Or the girl herself.
The gods created different thresholds with deadly challenges to guard the Vault of Heaven.
This is the first.
Anything heavier than a young child and this happens.
You must place a hand to that centre stone.
It is located at the height of one and a half men.
The vault will know if we send forth anything heavier than a child who's seen five cycles of the sun.
A weight - sensitive path.
30 paces to clear.
Nothing heavier than a child.
Throw a spear at it.
How many years do you think we've been at this problem?
Maybe you just need a bigger spear.
I've missed this part.
A well - planned attack.
We took these items from the assassins.
I was under the impression you were competent in your roll as protector of the palace.
The entrances were secured.
They leapt from adjoining rooftops.
Perhaps I should inform Lorenzo how difficult it is for you to keep intruders from climbing into windows.
They possessed an intimate knowledge of the palace.
Knowing exactly where to strike.
These men were n't Florentine.
They were sent here by Duke Federico of Urbino.
It's impressive to see your people craft the gears and devices I need so quickly.
I have a whole empire at my command.
They do n't think it looks like much.
This is the world's first self - propelled cart.
This little toy had better work.
Of course it will work.
It seems to be light enough.
Lucky thing, or you'd have been the next best alternative.
The Book of Leaves is our salvation.
This is how you know he's a Count.
Bishop of Rome and head of the Christian Church.
You should have an attendant doing that.
It's not whether you're competent to brush your own hair.
One receives as much respect as one demands.
By allowing yourself to be waited upon, you establish how vital it is for people to follow your word.
It's not something they taught me in the convent.
Moses reports no ill - effects from the attack we endured.
And the baby feels fine.
But... you keep me in the palace and you claim it's for my own safety.
But I almost lost my life.
My child's life.
You made me a target here.
The Medicis' enemies will follow that child wherever he goes.
It is not I who make you a target but you and the man you chose to bed.
The man I chose to bed will not define me.
I see you've renewed your studies.
It s mysteries demand our attention.
Its mysteries have already seduced my own nephew away from perfect obedience.
The only rage that should concern you is mine.
While I spend my days designing a holy war against our enemies, Cardinal, you renew your interest in a distraction.
My hope is that the book may offer some assistance in this conflict between our warring nations. The assistance I need, Cardinal, will come from the loyal subjects who surround me.
Not from superstitious old men who are spiraling into madness.
False idols will appear from all around us.
But the sin is not in their existence.
The sin is in their worship.
Heading to work bright and early?
I'm told Duke Federico sent them.
Something about last night strikes me as odd.
Years ago, Federico carved away his nose to give himself peripheral vision.
He's the least subtle man on the peninsular.
The kind who charges city gates.
Not the kind who sends hired assassins through palace windows.
Who else do you suspect?
Who profits most from the extinction of the Medici line?
The Medicis have made many enemies.
I do n't like your tone, Signor.
Then you're going to hate this.
Admit your role publically and I will do you the kindness of only slicing off your ear.
I'll even let you choose which one.
You'd never do that here.
Even the son of a bastard slave girl is n't that mad.
Do tell me what kind of man I am.
Suppose I did admit it... the Pope himself would defend me.
The Pope has damned us anyway.
Might as well act like it.
Pity you did n't get your money's worth.
There's an even 100 of them.
A question I ask myself often.
It was n't last time.
An even number of keyholes and yet there's a centre to the array.
We must save the key for another attempt.
No, I can solve this.
We are the Sun and the Moon.
There's constellations on every lock except that one.
It's the god they worship here.
Just let me think!
The whole thing adds up to 100.
100 is surely not a prime number.
There must be a single solitary keyhole somewhere else so the entire thing adds up to 101.
I will be with you soon.
Why would Rome send two such as you to parley with me?
We were chosen so none would suspect our mission as we travelled.
As is your beauty.
Which no doubt aided you in reaching my encampment.
You are the eldest son of the Sultan and heir to the Ottoman Empire.
Your strength is second to none.
I would n't dare seek an audience with only my charm to convince you of my goodwill.
I trust you will recognize this.
The Sword of Osman.
We travelled many miles knowing its significance would be lost if we failed to deliver it to your hands and to your hands alone.
What did you say your name was?
You risk coming to me again?
I serve a false Pope.
And you refuse to leave this cell.
What other choice do I have?
Have faith that my plans proceed as they must.
I intend to take my rightful place at the appropriate time.
The Bible has offered me no guidance here.
So you've turned to another book?
The Book of Leaves is a distraction.
Here my brother and I agree.
Locked it away in the bowels of the secret archives, forbidden me from even touching it.
It can not solve the world's ills.
It is our only recourse.
Do not raise suspicion.
And do not abandon me.
The Devil sits on the papal throne and your place is at my side.
Should I pray for another?
How is the girl?
Her child as well.
I hear there is an open position in the bank.
Signor Sassetti has left us quite abruptly.
Finance is a stressful business.
I am grateful for a reliable partner in our business.
The servants know about Lorenzo and Lucrezia.
Clearly they know about us.
I do appreciate however that for women reputation is a delicate thing.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
What I'm doing... is what I damn well please.
A pair of keyholes and a key that separates into two.
This one I took back.
From Zita's body.
Zo did n't want you inserting the key prematurely.
So you really imagine the architects of this structure would use the same deception twice.
Zo meant you no harm.
None of us do.
Do you truly imagine your Maestro would ever share what's behind these doors with me?
With the savage he wed only for a chance at the book.
Then you've learnt nothing.
It's far easier to hate than to trust.
I learned that lesson on our voyage here.
From a woman you loved.
And what of him?
Zo, tell him we're on the same side.
Why do n't you let someone who can pick a lock while drowning at sea take a look?
Dogs and their tricks.
The weapon my father employs for ceremonies is an artful replica constructed to disguise the loss of the true sword.
We discovered it languishing in the corridors of the Vatican.
His Holiness was ashamed to keep it from its rightful home.
I pray this gift demonstrates our good intentions, bey-effendi.
And what is it you want in return?
To bring you to Rome.
The future of the Ottoman Empire.
It's common knowledge that my half - brother Cem is the favored child of my father the Sultan.
But you are the first - born and you carry the blood and now the blade of Osman the First.
Some might say it is your destiny to rule.
You dare suggest I kill my brother?
I merely offer you a chance to demonstrate to your father that you are the most deserving heir.
Imagine a future where the Ottomans ruled the East and the Vatican rules the West.
This glory could be yours if you are brave enough to forge peace.
There is no need to spill another drop of Ottoman blood.
There is no need to repeat what happened to your brother.
Cem has been nothing but fortunate his entire life.
That is not the brother I meant.
You can not be blamed for your doubts.
Perhaps we should approach your father or Cem instead.
It's his key in that hole.
This one in the other.
Perhaps they need to be turned simultaneously.
Anyone who wins their way past this threshold will behold the Book of Leaves itself.
Oh, the engineering's amazing. No wonder that the natives believed that their land was visited by gods.
We must turn the keys when the light falls upon them.
Doors do n't have eyes.
There must be a pattern.
What is this place?
Perhaps these are the Nephilims, the offspring of the sons of God and the daughters of man and they created this vault.
Well, I'm normally opposed to assuming every wonder must have supernatural origins but all of this...
No other way out but heaven.
Let's get what we came here for.
Did you hear that?
I offer you the services of my companion to guide you to Rome.
And if it pleases you I will remain here and await word of your success and as surety of our trust in each other.
That trust only goes so far.
Keep her under guard outside the city gates.
She will not receive a single visitor.
She will not exchange a single message.
Bey- effendi, I have put myself at great risk in coming here to you and yet you repay me with incarceration?
I am the son of the Sultan about to embark on a journey to the den of my sworn enemy.
Do not speak to me of risk.
This is not what we agreed upon.
I can not trust a woman with so many weapons at her disposal.
There's someone here.
I heard a voice.
There's someone here with us!
What have you done to my friends?
It is you who have caused them pain.
You enter the vault without me by your side?
My visions were very clear.
No matter the cost.
So are we not joined as one? From the moment you arrived, it's been obvious your heart belongs to another.
This is what you missed last week on Shameless.
It was all about me.
Sort of the hero's journey.
Did I miss Christmas?
You almost missed Easter.
He'll be back, Debs.
He always comes back.
- Well, hello, Steve.
So you can imagine how happy I am to come here.
I've arranged for Estefania to pursue an economics degree.
When Immigration comes, you will be her husband.
But that means you ca n't get into any trouble.
How am I supposed to make a living?
Lost my job today.
We gonna have enough for the property tax bill?
Just, with the check I got today.
Lip and Ian left early?
They said they had to pick something up downtown before school.
- What they said.
Give me 1,000 bucks, I'll find you a night to promote.
You're on the calendar.
- Mm, back to sleep.
- I ca n't breathe.
I gotta pay the property tax.
Stop poking me with that thing.
What was I thinking?
Is this about the club thing?
I woke up having a panic attack that I was just like Frank and Monica taking our money, except I was n't even getting high with it.
You gotta be entrepreneurial, right?
Are you taking a dump right now?
- Like clockwork, every morning.
What, I ca n't take a dump in here?
You were in the shower.
Frank drunk looking for a bed.
Who the hell let him?
- We begged her not to.
He's not hot - bunking my bed.
Why ca n't he sleep out on the porch?
It's warm enough.
I want my old bed back.
You can sleep in my room.
Would n't do it, Debs.
He's especially ripe this morning.
- Gary the homeless guy.
- Come on, daddy.
Sweet dreams, daddy.
Hey, that's my tent.
I'll hose it off after he wakes up.
Debs, do n't let Frank in here anymore.
This is his home too.
And now he's back.
Did you wash up after you pooped?
What are you, my mom now?
We're supposed to wash up after we poop?
Tell your girlfriend to wear clothes, Lip.
Hey, you going to school today?
Later. Got ta skip my first three periods, so I can start clocking community service hours.
I did n't put in the money from that last
- toxic waste gig I had yet.
- Okay, that's cool.
Hand it over, and I'll drop it off before I go to community service, pay the tax man.
- Do n't have what?
I used it to put down a deposit on a club night.
Debs, Carl, let's go.
Gotta bring daddy his breakfast first.
We're always two weeks late.
I'll have the money back right after the party.
It was n't yours to spend.
Yeah, it was.
Oh, that's how we're doing this now.
Okay, well, I'll take the money I made last week and buy an iPad.
Ian, what are you gonna do with your paycheck, huh?
I have an opportunity to make some real money here, Lip.
I've been in the club business a long time.
Slinging cocktails, okay?
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Lip.
Good to have you home.
Can you help me with my social studies project?
Gotta build Lincoln's log cabin.
I'm trying to sleep.
You're walking me to the curb?
What, did I go back in time and turn six?
Have a good day at school, Carl.
Have you gotten a job yet?
- Nando told you to get a job.
Make sure you do n't get into trouble.
We are partners now.
Wherever you go, I go.
Like a married couple, huh?
Why they got you doing this, man?
Hit a kid with a brick.
Kinda broke his face.
Least there's always someone with some weed.
Hey, got any weed?
10 bucks a joint.
See, what'd I tell you?
What's up with the geek squad?
Wanted to get your staff list.
15% does n't work for you?
He brings in, like, a huge crowd.
It's your first gig.
What if she brought her own booze?
We'll get it from Kev.
Make more money, it'll work out better.
Gonna have to make it worth my while.
We could do the same split, except I keep the 85% and give you the 15%.
Bring your own booze.
But I want 20%.
Come on, GI.
Pound me like an Iraqi soldier.
What's going on under there?
I told you you were too loud.
Look, I ca n't get expelled.
My parents will kill me.
Lookee what we got here.
Thought you were still in juvie.
No, no, I swear.
Why are you still beating me up?
He was doing it too.
You're the one taking it in the ass, right?
Oh, my little chee- chee.
Mama's so tired.
Do n't you want to give your wee lungs
Oh, God, that's so loud.
Everything's so loud.
Maybe when we go inside, Jody can rub your tummy.
And mama, she can take a little nap.
I do n't remember Karen causing such a fuss as you, Hymie.
Maybe it's from your Chinese side.
Cool, you got Hymie to quiet down?
He's not trash!
- I'm such a terrible mother.
I do n't deserve to live.
We'll call Debbie to come baby - sit again, and we'll get some rest.
- I'm sorry, baby.
You ever shoot crack?
Ever eat mescaline - laced mushrooms?
20 bucks a joint.
Can I buy five?
About four blocks over.
I did n't choose it, I was just born there.
What are you doing slumming it down here?
Those flowers -- they're not gonna last about two hours.
Just looks good on my tufts application.
I'm not offended.
Hey, uh, you interested in beautifying any other parts of the neighborhood?
Anything to beef up my CV.
Think I may have something for you.
See if I can work it out.
Dude, hit me up anytime.
You got it, Casper Duncan.
Nice to switch back.
Thought you had four more months.
Coming back to school?
I have n't passed a single class.
Why'd you come back, then?
Fronted a bunch of coke before I went in.
Third call this week from that same woman, Kev.
- She wo n't leave a message?
Can you just keep dodging her, please?
How's the foot?
It's goddamn itchy.
What are you two foxy ladies up to?
Need to bum some liquor off ya.
For her club night.
What, they do n't have booze over there?
She'll make more money if she brings her own.
Okay, how much you need?
There's gonna be at least 200 people there, babe.
Have you ever seen more than 20 deadbeats in here at one time?
What about your liquor distributor?
Could I get the booze from them?
You're dealing with the mob?
You never told me that.
Stan burned every bridge in town.
Walter's the only liquor distributor that'll do business with us.
How much would the booze cost?
Would he let me set up an account and invoice me later?
He'll do a credit check, though.
I've got perfect credit.
No credit does not equal perfect credit.
Do you even have a social security number?
He'll want you to leave one of the kids as collateral.
I'll just buy the booze from him up front, then.
Whose money you gonna use?
- How's it going, Jim-nasium?
- Hey, what's going on?
Can I borrow some money from you?
Pay you back after my club night?
Yeah, kinda strapped right now.
Are those my jeans, Frank?
Found'em upstairs in my room.
It's not your room anymore.
You're cutting her jeans into shorts?
Had three pair of my own, but somebody tossed my clothes.
These are, like, $120.
Can you go to the bank and get more money?
I have n't gotten anything from them since I was 18.
- Cars, insurance.
Okay, I have n't gotten any cash from them since I was 18.
For two years you've been offering to give me money, and now when I ask, you do n't have any?
This is why I never ask anybody for help.
- I feel like a jackass now.
- Whoa, hey. Are you mad at me?
Because you get mad at me when I offer you money, and now you're getting mad because I ca n't?
I'll just figure it out myself, okay?
- Let's go, V.
Frank, what the hell?
I got that roast chicken for dinner tonight!
My house, my kitchen, my fridge, my chicken.
I cut these too short.
Thought you were my history teacher Mr. Crouch.
Well, sorry to disappoint.
Hey, how was Community Service?
Think I can make some dough off 'em.
Well, that was cunty of her.
You know, you should be in charge of your family's money, not Fiona.
Mr. Gallagher, just left Mr. Healey's office.
Rumors about you two true?
Said you were supposed to ask me for a recommendation.
Sure, in his mind, I was supposed to do that.
A letter of recommendation from a science teacher looks good on your college applications.
So we got 20 cases of beer, 16 cases of wine, got two cases of champagne.
I got 10 liters of vodka, six gin, four rum, four scotch, four bourbon, and enough mixers and garnishes for, like, 200 people.
- Sound about right?
And I can return whatever I do n't use?
Let me just tally this up here for you.
I hope the payment does n't involve my titties.
How would you like to pay for this?
- Need a pen?
Is there more than $17 in that account?
By the time the check clears, I'll have it covered.
The guy is in the mob.
Got ta be entrepreneurial, right?
If I do n't invest in myself, no one else ever will.
Oh, surprised to see you at the college counseling center, Miss Milkovich.
Came to talk to you about Lip.
I'm not at liberty to discuss another student, but I'd be more than happy to help you with your future options.
You and I both know my only options are getting pregnant or getting arrested, so cut the crap.
He's got a good chance of getting out of here.
And what are you doing about it?
Encouraging him to go to college.
Does n't seem to be too interested.
You're a guidance counselor.
There's only so much I can do.
- What should he be doing?
Getting teacher recommendations, finding himself a legitimate job, filling out his college applications.
Now, you think you can help with any of that?
All right, stop by at the end of the day, I'll post some college brochures, you could take'em with you.
I think you have a better chance of getting through to him than I did, Lysistrata.
Show up for English once in a while, and you'll get the reference.
You seriously gonna keep following me everywhere I go?
Do n't you ever have to go to the bathroom?
Why are you breathing so hard?
You never know with you.
So Beto is sitting out front.
He follows me wherever I go.
Your father told him to keep an eye on me?
Your father or Beto?
Because neither of them seemed harmless when they were dicing up Marco.
Just a second, Frank.
Stay out of trouble, and you'll be fine.
All right, listen. I gotta go.
I gotta run some errands, make some money for Fiona.
Look, my dad is a hothead.
Blows off steam, threatens lives, and then cools down, forgets why he was mad.
He will call Beto off soon.
What happened to all the meth heads squatting in here?
Took me six months to get rid of 'em.
Yeah, I heard there were dead bodies in there too.
Gon na take me eight weeks to make it livable again.
How much you paying these guys?
Might have a better deal for you.
- How's the pasta?
You're like our maid now.
- I gotta run an errand.
- Baby - sitting for Sheila.
Can I stay up late and watch TV?
I'm going to Sheila's tonight, daddy.
A noble job, Debs.
That stupid baby's still crying?
Hey, that's my toothbrush.
And thanks for sharing it with me, son.
- Now that we're a family again, I want to encourage us to be all for one and one for all.
Ew, gonna have to boil it now.
You need the number over at Sheila's?
Where I'll be.
No, why would I?
I have a pillowcase full of bars of soap.
Planning to go to Carnegie Mellon?
That's for nerds and homos.
But, um, Healey thinks Lip should apply.
He's smart enough.
Yeah, but too stupid to do anything about it.
Hey, can I ask you a question?
How do you know if a guy you've been hanging out with likes you?
Uh - huh, but I think he hates me.
Does n't want to talk about it.
No guy ever does.
How do I know, then?
Does he get that look in his eye when he's with you?
Did you know that Abe Lincoln lived in a one - room log cabin when he was born, Hymie, and that his grandfather was ambushed and killed by indians?
Some historians say that because he was cold to women, he might've had homosexual tendencies.
The whole point of you baby - sitting Hymie was to keep him quiet, so Jody and I could get some sleep.
Sorry, Sheila, he wo n't stop.
Why do n't you take him for a walk?
- I do n't care.
I am... running an errand.
Uh, at V's, changing.
I'm gonna run by the club, talk to this promoter.
See if we can get his email list to invite more people to my party.
You mind watching the kids?
Why you steal Porsche?
I needed money to help my girlfriend.
You have a car at home.
How am I supposed to get around?
Nando will kill us both if you get into trouble.
Okay, I promise not to do it again, okay?
Do n't screw with me again.
I take you to the hospital, then we go get American Whoppers, huh?
Hey, Meg, is Wendell around?
Uh, yeah, right over there.
I'll tell you this.
For all of their laziness and lack of motivation, Mexicans are a lovely people.
Why'd you go down there, Frank?
Hey, I'll take another, Kev.
Sometimes a man just has to get away, be alone with his thoughts.
So what, you woke up from a drunken stupor, did n't know where you were?
I knew exactly where I was.
Had a business opportunity with our south - of - the - border brothers.
- What did you do to your foot?
- It fell off.
Was the only prosthetic I could afford.
What kind of business opportunity?
I was hired to move some inventory.
Only the best the mexicanos have ever seen.
Not something you really want to be bragging about, Frank.
Some chick's outside with a baby looking for you.
- Who is it, Frank?
I'm gonna slip out the back.
Sounds like you were slipping it out the back in Mexico, Frank.
Wait, you're the chick with the baby?
Kev wo n't let me in after 6:00 PM anymore.
What the hell's wrong with Liam?
- This is n't Liam, it's Hymie.
Sheila has an oriental baby?
You were always so good with Liam.
It always worked with you.
Hey, loan me 20 bucks, will ya?
I only have five.
Your friend likes to dance.
The tequila likes to dance.
So you think you're gonna be able to pull this off tomorrow night?
I bet you will.
Looks like you have some real talent.
You're not talking about my club promoting skills, are you?
Your hand on my knee.
I meant to put it up your skirt.
What are the chances of me getting ahold of your email lists?
Why would I give them to you?
No, I ca n't come inside that.
You know how long it took me to build up my list?
You honestly think I'd risk it on you throwing some lame party and ruining my brand for anything less than 50%?
Well, that's an interesting offer.
Let me discuss it with my partner.
He wants 50% of the bar for his email list, and he's a giant douche bag.
I swiped his phone from his jacket as soon as I saw his hand on your knee.
- Nighty - night, Hymie.
How did you do it, Debbie?
Daddy's good with babies.
You just getting home?
Slammed it in the door.
- Well, you're in trouble.
You let Carl stay up late on a school night.
I think you need a spanking.
I ca n't do it with your pants on, though.
Then I should take them off.
This Purdue place looks cool.
I want mommy to show me how bad I've been.
Says they're one of the top engineering schools in the country.
I'm gonna have to figure out a way to make up the 1,000 bucks she's gonna lose.
Is it wrong that it's kind of turning me on?
Jimmy gonna come down to make us breakfast?
He's sleeping in.
- Wore him out, huh?
Gon na be a big success.
Probably make enough money to roll it into another one.
What's wrong, Debs?
So the ghet to girl thinks she can live the American dream, huh?
Maybe it's my time, Lip.
None of your business, Mandy.
When you're poor, only way to make money is to steal it or scam it, like Don King or Joe Kennedy.
- Just dump it.
- Hey, that's my bike!
Does n't really work anymore.
Yeah, because you bent the rim, Frank.
And where's the seat?
That's why it hurt so much when I rode it.
Come on, fellas.
Get some brekkie, soak up the alcohol.
- Do you have sourdough?
- Hey, this is our food!
Do n't be rude.
Is this about money, Fiona?
Because I am happy to pay my share.
That's all you ever want from me anymore anyway.
That's about $300 worth.
Come on, lads!
Let's go upstairs, take a disco nap till the Alibi's open again.
Dad, no, no.
- Lip, do n't.
You have no right to kick me out of it.
I am an important part of this family.
You do n't live here anymore.
If that's the way you want it, I'll leave.
Phil, Chester, I'm sorry.
My family does n't want me here anymore.
Just pick a bed, fellas!
You are not sleeping here.
He's not doing anything!
I treated you well!
- How could you do this to me?
- I do n't even care!
- Get him out.
- Ow, God!
After everything I have done for you, this is the thanks I get.
- Where should we put him?
- Where he belongs.
- Open it up, Carl!
Gonna need you to clean the blood splatter on the walls, evidence marks on the floor, and patch up the bullet holes.
- Supplies are inside.
You okay, buddy?
Been trying all morning to get tickets to the Wilco concert at Soldier Field tonight.
- Ca n't get through.
Come on, Wilco is the beacon of anti-commercialism.
Yeah, because no one wants to buy their whiny music, they gotta give it away for free.
It's 50 bucks a head.
That's $400.
I have n't seen what they could do yet.
No, no, I did n't steal them, I just underbid you.
But we are illegal immigrants.
How can you underbid us?
Ghetto white's the new brown.
Just living the American dream, amigo!
Okay, let's keep eight cases of that beer up front, and put the rest in the back refrigerator.
People showing up already?
Just a friendly visit.
You know, make sure you filled out all your applications.
Business license, liquor license, umbrella insurance.
Well, I'm sure Meg handled everything that you need.
Well, you're running the show now, right?
Well, just for tonight.
Would n't want any pesky policemen or firemen showing up now, would we?
I'll come back later to collect.
Let's say 2:00 AM.
How is the pinky?
So listen, my girlfriend's having a party tonight.
It's important that I go.
Is there going to be alcohol there?
It's a party, it's kind of how these things work, yeah.
- Bad things may happen.
- Yeah, or not.
I go with you.
I mean, that wo n't go over very well.
Then you stay home.
- Time to pay up.
- They let you out?
I thought I had four more months.
Did n't want you to get busted.
I can look after myself, thank you.
Does he get that look in his eye -- look in his eye -- look in his eye when he's with you?
Just got outta juvie, remember?
You okay with what happened this morning?
Jimmy's in the bathroom puking.
Something I ate. It's not sitting well.
No, I'm just bummed I ca n't make it tonight.
If you feel better later, come on over, okay?
I know, I know, you want me to find Jesus.
I already found him, thanks.
I'm looking for Kev.
Hey, you still got that garage?
Yeah, it kinda comes with the house, Frank.
What's say you let me sleep there?
- Why the hell not?
The layout of your home is very confusing.
You ca n't stay with me, Frank.
What if you immigrate to Mexico, Frank?
Why are you even here?
Should be collecting disability.
Hey, let me crash at your place.
Why ca n't you stay at your place, Frank?
Things I do for them.
Blood, sweat, and tears.
This is not how a family treats each other.
Hey, baby, what's going on?
No, yeah, okay.
Okay, I'll be right there.
Orphan Annie turned on me.
That's how I got all these bruises.
She hit me. With a bat.
Now, I ca n't touch her.
That is child abuse.
I'd get reported.
Operator, can you connect me with Child Welfare Ser --
Six kids living in squalor.
When the father is there, he's drunk.
They're all criminals, delinquents, viol -
Even for you, Frank.
Hey, V, where are you?
This place is insane!
Hey, is this the club where Wilco's gonna play a secret concert?
- I'll park it myself.
That lovely lady will show you to your spot.
Got your text about the impromptu Wilco concert.
I'll have someone park your car.
How long we doing this for?
Figure we park about 30 more cars, make enough money to cover the property tax, at which time people will probably start to realize
Where am I supposed to go?
Just shake him.
You're not supposed to shake a baby.
I know, but maybe it'll make him stop crying.
Yeah, because his brains will get scrambled.
- They already are!
I'm just saying maybe it'll scramble'em back together again.
You need help with that baby?
- How'd you get in my house?
I still have a key.
- Frank, you have to leave.
No, let me stay, and I'll be your wet nurse.
I do n't mean your wet nurse, that involves breast - feeding, but your nurse, your baby nurse.
Room and board, you'll get eight hours of sleep a night.
Debbie did say he was good with babies.
Give me 30 seconds.
If I ca n't put this little tyke to sleep, I'll -
Raised eight kids myself.
I know what I'm doing.
I think I'll take a shower before bed.
So, 15% for you.
I thought we agreed on 20.
Take mine anytime you're ready.
Look forward to doing business with you in the future.
This is to cover my booze.
And that leaves me with 2 grand.
- Five, six, seven, eight... $900?
That's all I have left?
But that does n't even cover my deposit.
I lost $100 doing this night.
You gotta pay your dues.
How'd you do?
It's gonna take a while till I start making money.
Almost all of it.
- Ah, keep it.
Well, if you're gonna gamble our money, you should hold onto it, right?
I was trying to better our situation, Lip.
You risked everything, and you did n't even break even.
It was my first time doing this.
You made a decision without consulting the rest of us.
- I'm in charge of this family.
You see, Fiona, if we're gonna be every man for himself, this family is going under fast.
Here, just take the money, okay?
Pay the property tax.
I'll get the rest tomorrow somehow.
I took care of the situation myself.
Told a bunch of North Side kids that Wilco was playing at your party.
The only way to make money when you're poor is to steal it or scam it.
Maybe I'll have to take over the family money, huh?
Are we sure about this?
He's like the baby whisperer.
You did n't have to do this.
Who told him to do this, Mei?
This is because of you and your men!
You listen to me!
Did Robin talk to you about what he was doing today, where he was going?
He said he trusted you.
He believed in you.
Sir, where to?
We're going to need a new base.
Somewhere off the grid.
Away from this bloody mess.
What about Stonebridge's civilian contact?
That is a very good idea.
We'll set up the crib there.
They're bringing in McQueen.
How's the shoulder, Mikey?
You have to pop it back in.
Bravo One and Two, send sit -rep.
We're regrouping at Garland's place.
McQueen's our only link to the people behind it.
You get him back fast.
They're not going to let you take me.
We're doing a pretty good job of it so far.
Lower your weapons and raise your hands.
If you do not comply, we will open fire. '
We're from the embassy.
We're British officials.
You have five seconds to comply.
Any ideas, Mikey?
Yeah, let's put the guns down and raise our hands.
Raise the other hand!
I'm taking this man into custody.
- 'Hands up!
It's always negotiable.
You take care of yourselves, boys.
Un - cuff me.
Un - cuff me, Janjai.
Kill him. 'I ca n't.
Not all these men are mine. '
He is a liability. 'Do n't worry.
He wo n't talk.
Lee, we had a deal.
I told you what would happen if you failed.
No failure on my end.
They're going to kill me.
There goes the one link into finding out who's behind all this.
You know what, Mikey?
I predict this is going to end in some big gunfight, a lot of bloodshed, you and me stuck in the middle.
Well... what are we waiting for?
Philip, in one hour I have to explain to the PM how our own ambassador facilitated the assassination of the North Korean delegates.
And how the hell some low - level British thug like McQueen can be behind it all.
I think he was working for someone else. 'Who?
What I do know is that someone paid him to kidnap Foster's daughter and then forced the ambassador to carry a bomb through security.
And you could n't stop it?
Well, we had him and then we lost him.
Philip, I understand things happen in the field but if your men are n't up to the task...
We have a lead on McQueen.
I'm on my way there now.
Bring him in. '
That has n't changed so, please, do n't let me down.
This is the safe house?
Not on our budget.
Ladies, this way.
Here you go, ladies.
How you doing, Mike?
Does this stuff even work?
It old but it's good equipment.
I keep it squared away for any operators that come through.
Anything more I can do, you let me know.
Thanks for everything, Tom.
Officials in Pyongyang are calling the death of
General Ong Ji - Woo an act of war.
They warn that reprisals will be swift and aggressive.
They went in about an hour ago.
I made some calls.
The Thai police are saying they do n't have him.
I saw him walk in.
Bravo Two, are you in position?
I should be out there with you.
Got eyes on McQueen.
Bravo Two, are you in pursuit?
Well, Mr Benz, you follow that police car.
Wherever they go, we go.
Mike, there is still no record of McQueen in the Thai system.
Bravo Two, wherever they're taking McQueen, it's not official.
We can not afford to lose him again.
So is that an order to take down a Thai police convoy?
No, I want us to retrieve a prisoner that you lost, Scott.
Yeah, funny, sure.
You take down police convoy with a couple of water pistols.
You do n't think that's funny?
Look, you want out, I'll give you 100 baht for this piece of junk.
Hey, you get tuk - tuk, you get nothing.
Yeah, it means fun, huh?
Yeah, and I have n't had fun like this since I was a monk.
You were a monk?
You were not a monk?
Yeah, Scott, you should try it.
Oh, no, I think Michael's got that monk thing covered.
What, you're taking a call now?
I've got to, boss.
Do n't get too close.
Yes, I'm in Bangkok.
Do n't lose them, Benz.
I am number one tuk - tuk in Bangkok.
I missed my kid's 16th birthday.
He got drunk and boosted a car.
Got on a plane to Bangkok.
He's going to be here in 17 hours.
I wait here for you, OK?
You're not going to come?
What about your sense of sanuk, huh?
Sanuk OK, but if I die, many, many unhappy ladies!
Hey, for you.
Yeah, too many people here do n't like to pay.
Exactly what kind of monk were you?
I know what you're doing.
I've put a dozen bodies in here myself.
I made you a rich man.
This is how you want to repay me, yeah?
You marry a Thai and you think you can be one of us.
I count four swats with MP5s.
Nah, not really.
He's my own son.
And what do I tell him I do for a job?
Saving the bad guy from the worse guy?
That's the easy part.
You come to bleed my country.
I bleed you instead.
So what's our plan?
I was getting to that.
When Lee's got no more use for you, he will find someone to put a bullet through your head.
Turn over a rock, and a dozen like you.
But I'm sorry about your wife and baby.
I have my order.
I'll get McQueen.
You do n't get off that easy.
Scott, talk to me!
Coming to you, boss.
I got the package.
Who begged you to take that girl?
Do n't talk, I will shoot you.
Just hit him again.
Neither of them are mine.
All right, scumbag.
We get your wife safe and you tell us who's behind the kidnapping, the bombing, everything.
You get her safe, I'll tell you whatever you want.
You got that, Mikey?
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
We've got this one, boss.
Stick him in there.
McQueen, you better start thinking about what you're going to tell us.
When my wife is safe.
I'll tell you one thing.
You guys are going to need more men.
You still have operational command until I get back.
Can I ask where you're going?
You know what, Michael?
He was n't half bad.
No, I'm all right, thanks.
How's this whole operational command going for you?
To tell you the truth, it's not really my cup of tea.
That kind of suits you.
Bet you could get used to it.
Well, old Locke ca n't run the unit forever, can he?
One of us is going to have to step up.
Have you given it some thought?
Just a little bit?
Yeah, I think about it all the time.
Me sitting in here stuck behind a desk while you're out there having all the fun.
Sounds kind of good to me.
You want to tell me what's wrong or are you just going to drink it away?
That's when Finn lands in Bangkok.
Zero from Bravo Three, we're at the location.
Changrok's boys beat us to it.
All right, I'm Zero.
Zero from Brave Three and Four, 'proceed, watch your corners..... and your fine little asses.'
Thanks for the tip, Zero!
And you can kiss my ass.
My name is Kim Martinez.
You think I'm stupid?
He told me to tell you that your daughter's going to be a Muay Thai champion.
Give me the goddamn gun!
What took you so long?
Mei, I just wanted to talk to him.
This happened because of you.
I do n't want you to be talking to him.
What would he say?
If you know something, you have to tell me.
What, so you can bury him?
No, so I can help him.
So, what would he say?
What would he tell me?
He killed those people, he knew there would be terrible consequences.
To save our daughter's life.
What would you have done for your son?
No - one gave me that choice.
If they had, you would have done the same thing.
Tell me that is n't true.
Somebody has to take the blame for this.
Because we have the man who took Chloe.
Has he said anything?
He's just a puppet for someone else, but...
I promise you, Mei, he will talk.
We'll gain leverage and he will tell us everything.
And then we'll find out who's really behind this.
Everything is going to be OK, sweetheart.
Shut her up, that's enough.
Put her over there.
The man I deal with is called Lee.
He's not Thai, he's North Korean.
You're saying a North Korean paid you?
To kidnap the ambassador's daughter and make the ambassador plant a bomb?
To blow up some North Koreans.
Look, Lee is no ordinary North Korean.
He's Office 39.
It meant nothing to me the first time I heard it.
Into drugs, human trafficking, murder, anything that generates hard currency for the North Korean nuclear missile programme.
What does n't make sense to me is why would they blow up their own diplomats?
So they can blame the West for the incident.
The embassy bomb was just the first step.
We need hard intel, anything that points to their next move.
Where do we find them, McQueen?
They operate out of an abandoned high - rise near the docks.
Lee's main base is the top of the tower.
The place is locked down.
No way in, no way out.
Hey, Mikey, going up?
I checked Lee Dae - Ho against all known aliases.
If he's Office 39, he probably would've worked through the North Korean First Bureau, which led me to this.
How did Changrok know we were here?
Were you tailed, Colonel?
I'm sure of it.
I told you - Office 39 know everything.
Will you shut up?
Richmond, give Bravo Team a sit - rep then exfil.
Bravo team, crib has been compromised.
We're on the move and going dark. 'Do we need back - up?
Do you want us to abort?
What, you're asking me?
You're the one being groomed for command, Mikey.
We need to move.
Malai, you stay close to me.
All right, put your hand there and you keep it there.
Exfil via the roof, one floor up.
It's a good plan.
You know what they say about plans, Mikey.
They never survive contact with the enemy.
You did n't know I knew that one, huh?
We should get these boys to clean the crib.
Where is that exit?
Do n't even think about it.
Let me out, give me the gun.
Cover us and I can get her out of here.
Make sure she remembers her daddy.
You know you're dying.
If you have a God, pray.
We are not the bad men.
We are the pawns for the greater power.
Easy for you to say, Changrok.
It's good to believe in something, right?
See you in the next life, motherf 25th floor, Mikey.
Yeah, but who?
I saw his wife and their assistant Lawan.
Lawan was there for everything.
Handed over the first message from the kidnappers.
She could have tipped them off about you in the nightclub and she could have followed me from the hospital.
Well, let's question her.
She's at the hospital with Foster and Mei.
Mrs Foster, I've arranged the car to take you and Chloe back to the residence.
No, I'm not leaving.
I want to stay here with Dad.
He needs to rest and so do you.
At least go with Lawan to get something to eat.
Gentlemen, there's a lot of equipment up here.
Been looking up some porn?
Whatever it is, I'm going to find out.
English, do you speak it?
But you understood that.
That's convenient, is n't it?
What's Office 39 doing here?
Whatever it is, this little machine here is going to find out exactly what he's up to.
I'm not Richmond!
Well, maybe you should be.
You, look right here.
You're going to flood the market with your counterfeit currency, is that it?
Yeah, that's right, what is "Sasam"?
We know you speak it.
Hey, he's got cyanide!
I've got him.
You pick up that folder.
Scott, I'm on the north side of the building.
Coming up on your six, Mike.
We are heading towards the hospital.
Nice to see you.
Yeah, that's easier said than done, boss.
You said it, Mikey.
Just make sure you bring me that intel. '
Poor planning, Michael.
Speaking of which, there must be half a tonne of meth in those barrels.
That's a no.
Then you will die up here.
I think you got that the wrong way round, buddy.
You will kill me?
I serve a higher power.
Yeah, I can arrange that.
We're coming, we're coming.
You had the ambassador kill the general of your country.
You need to clear that up for me before we die.
I follow orders, as you do.
I want to meet your boss.
Mate, when a Bangkok tuk - tuk is your go - to exfil plan, I seriously have to question your tactical choices.
This is n't just any tuk - tuk.
This is Benz 'tuk - tuk.
Benz, this is Mikey, my partner.
Yeah, I'm best number one tuk - tuk in Bangkok.
We've got the intel and took out the entire meth shipment in the process.
I'll brief you when you get here. '
What's Finn's ETA?
Think I can make it?
I'm thinking about taking Julia along.
What, for back - up?
Things have been going real nice.
Thanks, my man.
Ah, you two very good together.
Maybe you two get married, yeah?
Yeah, well, your invite's in the post.
Which one of you will wear the dress?
It's Foster's assistant Lawan.
Her file says her parents are South Korean, but we have intel that says her father is from the North.
So she's involved in this?
Well, someone's on the inside feeding them intelligence.
You did what you had to do.
No. After what I did, I deserved to die in that explosion.
But you should have.
It would have been easier that way.
It's Philip, please.
How are you holding up?
We came to see your dad.
I could take you to see him.
Why does n't Chloe take me?
You want to come with us?
Oh, that's nothing to worry about.
Chloe, listen to me.
Whatever anyone says about your father in the days to come, he is one of the few men I know who still believes in honour.
I've thought about this moment for a long time.
In the dark hours, during dinners, drinks, family outings, our life together...
I wondered, Robin, how I'd feel at the end of it all.
I was even scared to think that, at the final moment, the love that I claimed for you would turn itself into something real.
I suppose I'm almost disappointed.
Because there's nothing there.
I feel nothing at all.
Because it is time.
Better to be an ambassador's widow than a wife.
All the freedom without this.
My name is not Mei.
My name has never been Mei.
For the sake of the humiliated and suffering people of North Korea, Robin.
Dad, no, no!
Know what photokeratitis is?
How about flash blindness?
The same thing, really.
Both caused by excessive exposure to ultraviolet light.
Cornea burns, unable to handle the light's intensity.
And you temporarily lose your vision.
The theory... pain is only psychological since the retina has no pain receptors.
This particular model was built by Homeland Security to torture prisoners after 9/11.
Doctor says you're gonna be all right.
Your body is fighting off the infection.
I'm gonna lift up your head, okay?
It's gonna sting.
Do you have any idea... what you're even doing?
You're still breathing, are n't you?
You gonna invite us in?
Colonel Stowe may have been crazy, but he was still military and kept meticulous records.
So then she came back to you?
Y'all know busting through walls is my specialty.
Okay, so then you stole the Genoa files from CID?
Do n't need to steal when you got the power of persuasion.
Finally got to the right record clerk in the Pentagon.
There was a list of everyone working on the base that day.
So you compared it to the list of casualties?
I'm guessing you know how to find this Leo?
Of course, soldier boy.
I've never been on my own before.
You're not anymore.
- What is it, Deputy?
- I think it's more than that.
See, all three releases were connected to you.
Whoever the vigilante is, they know you've got the DA in your pocket.
Someone's sending you a message.
- What do you think, Deputy?
- I think Brock makes a lot of noise, but he'd never come after you like that.
- It could get messy.
Then you'll clean it up.
You hired me to be your eyes and your ears.
I do n't mind doing the cleaning, but that costs more.
Then you better be worth it.
- Helen, the damn Internet is broken again.
The Bowmans are here to see you.
- Shall I bring them upstairs?
Try to fix this.
- Mr. and Mrs. Bowman.
The county coroner wo n't release Rebecca's body to us.
Unfortunately, the body ca n't be released until the coroner has determined an official cause of death.
The funeral must be held immediately.
- This is our way.
It's been a week since our daughter's passing.
I know, and I assure you my entire department is working day and night on your daughter's case.
You have no right to keep her from us.
- Please, let us put her to rest.
all right, let me make some calls.
I'll try to move things along, okay?
- Come. Let's go.
Again, I'm sorry for your loss.
With technology crossing cultural boundaries, computer ethics are virtually intractable.
Well, how can we set a global standard when cultural relativism makes it impossible?
And by they, I mean the United States government.
But what they can do is enforce title 18, section 1030.
If you are caught accessing a computer with intent to steal information or damage a network, you will go to jail.
And when you're out, you'll get a six - figure gig as a security analyst.
I'll see you all next week.
Go to the next station.
Please stand clear of the doors.
- I'm on the train.
Next stop, Wallace Street.
- He's on the train.
About time, soldier boy.
Just get him in the car!
Yeah, got him.
- Hi, Kurt.
- I heard you were back.
- What are you doing here?
- I brought you some groceries.
I do n't need any help.
Yeah, of course you do n't.
- Are you gonna let me in?
I called the hospital every week to check on you.
- No one told me.
- I asked them not to.
I know that it was Calvin and his goons that did that to you.
Why did n't you report them?
- That you asking or Calvin?
- Do n't be an asshole.
You know he'd kill me if he knew I was here.
I want to kill him for what he did to you.
It's just amazing how two brothers can be so different and so alike at the same time.
If you need anything.
I ca n't do this, Kurt.
You think you can still get him out?
But after this... I know there's no coming back for him.
That's gonna take some time.
Time's not gonna change anything, Kurt.
Just kill him now.
I ca n't kill my own brother.
- He's Hank's father.
- Kurt, when I was a little girl, my father poisoned me with fear.
He made sure that I would only ever feel safe if I was with a man just like him.
And I just accepted that.
That that's how things would always be.
And then you came back.
For the first time in my life, I thought things could be different.
But this is n't about me.
- I wo n't let that happen.
You have to trust me, Maggie.
- I do n't know who that is.
Tell me another lie.
See how this works?
When she gets tired, I'm gonna start.
You took our friend.
We want him back.
Untie me, and I'll think about helping you.
The boy ca n't talk if he ai n't conscious.
Now take Nikita to the kitchen.
Give me and Sugar a minute.
You were just doing what we all wanted to.
Just everybody disappeared all at once.
Job knew the risks.
I'm not talking about Job.
You know, I spent nearly two years up in those hills blaming myself for everything that happened.
Now, that would have been a big waste of time if this was all your fault.
Mr. Fitzpatrick has had a change of heart.
You always travel with a handsaw?
After Genoa, Job was interrogated for three months straight.
They worked him for names, dates, everything.
So they gave up and they marked him for EDE.
- What the hell is that?
- Extended detainment and exploitation.
It's usually reserved for enemies of the state who require some extra motivation.
So where is he now?
- They're keeping him in a black site.
A supermax hellhole that makes Abu Ghraib look like the Four Seasons.
- How do we get in there?
- No one gets in, period.
- Wrong answer, homes.
No one gets in, but we might be able to buy him out if you have the cash.
- No, do n't!
The money is not for me!
Look, the government needs plausible deniability, so these places, they are completely autonomous.
The guys who are running them, they answer to no one.
Sometimes they'll deal.
- How much do you have?
So much for early retirement.
He'll get over it.
Glad you kept it safe for us all these months.
Yeah, I was saving it for a rainy day.
I made the deal.
The money is here.
I am staring right at it.
But if he dies, you get nothing, you hear me?
- Job is scheduled to go dark.
It means they have no further use for him.
It could be two days, it could be two hours.
You want him back alive, we need to go now.
Okay, I'm gonna pretend I did n't see that.
You never heard of the five - second rule?
Well, she's tied, but it's gonna be some time before I finish the full pathology.
No, we are out of time, Dan.
I need to get this girl's body home to her family.
I hope you're not asking me to rush the autopsy for the victim of an alleged serial killer.
Tell me what you have so far, then, all right?
Do n't test me, Dan.
Jesus Christ, Brock, relax.
Well... puncture wounds and tearing of the soft tissue are consistent with animal bites, but they were most likely caused postmortem.
Right, she was already dead when he dumped her body in the woods.
But she was still alive when he filleted her chest and cut her heart out.
So it is the same as the other two girls.
I'll bet a week's pay the tox screen will find similar traces of Valium and Demerol in her system.
He probably used just enough to keep her conscious, but knock the fight out of her.
God damn it, Dan.
This guy's good, Brock!
He covers his tracks like a pro.
I've got the opposite of nothing.
You do n't look like our usual clientele.
I'll just have a cup of coffee.
Could I help you with something?
- Um, how much for a piece of pie?
That's all I got.
How about a cup of coffee?
I'll pay for the pie.
- And a glass of milk?
- Sure. Whatever you like.
Where are your parents, Jennifer?
You have your own bathroom, Jacuzzi tub.
There's plenty of fresh towels.
Should all fit you nicely.
I just want you to feel comfortable, nothing more.
You must be tired.
You can stay as long as you like.
Hey... whose room is this?
Someone who was very special to me.
I'm afraid our time together has come to an end.
- Let's get you home.
- If you have to ask, you already know.
For future reference, we do n't make deals.
I was just wondering.
Please do n't hurt me.
I gave you freedom!
I gave you a place to stay!
I gave you everything.
Thanks, but what I really need is for you to pull your head out of your ass.
What the hell were you thinking shooting porn in Banshee?
You talked to Proctor.
- And so am I.
- I saw an opportunity to earn...
You need to get your priorities straight, boy.
We have an army 10 times bigger than his.
Because I say so.
There are some other reasons I do n't want to get into, but for your purposes, that's the only one you need.
- No more fuckups.
It's taco Tuesday.
I'm sorry, Miriam.
I ca n't legally do anything to make them release the body.
Since when has legal ever stopped you?
I'll personally bring Rebecca home to you as soon as I possibly can, I promise.
When Rebecca left us, I prayed that she'd return.
But when you took her in,
I knew that God had forsaken my prayers.
Her blood is on your hands, Kai.
And for that, I will never forgive you.
You rescued me from that hellhole and the first place you bring me back is here?
Baby, you heartless.
I think we could all use another drink.
I've been saving it for a special occasion.
I just need to get some rest.
Somebody better start talking now.
Buying them off was n't cheap.
Leo got away with the bag.
- So after all that time, I got nothing.
You still got your place in the back, Job.
- The kids are away.
It'll be quiet.
- And what about Gordon?
Is he in or is he out?
Gordon did n't make it.
Thank you all for coming to get me.
Next time you can tell me why it took 20 months.
You're under arrest for the murder of Rebecca Bowman.
Brock, is this a joke?
Sir, I'm sorry, but we have a warrant.
- Brock, you know I did n't do it.
- Yeah? Then maybe you want to tell me how your blood ended up inside of her car.
And I'm guessing you have no idea how you knocked her up either.
Yeah, Bunker, put the cuffs on this man.
- Okay, wait a minute.
- Hey. Cruz, stand down.
Get him in the car.
So... did I miss anything while I was gone?

Teniposide causes dose - dependent single - and double - stranded breaks in DNA and DNA - protein cross-links. The substance has been found to act as an inhibitor of topoisomerase II (an enzyme that aids in DNA unwinding), since it does not intercalate into DNA or bind strongly to DNA.
The cytotoxic effects of teniposide are related to the relative number of double - stranded DNA breaks produced in cells, which are a reflection of the stabilization of a topoisomerase II - DNA intermediate.

Although some European politicians have called for Europe's internal borders to be temporarily closed, the European Union decided to turn down the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel area and introducing border controls with Italy. The deputy leader of the Swiss Ticino League, Lorenzo Quadri, criticized the decision: "It is alarming that the dogma of wide - open borders is considered a priority."

In Syria, Lebanon and Cyprus, meze is often a meal in its own right. There are vegetarian, meat or fish mezes.
Groups of dishes arrive at the table about 4 or 5 at a time (usually between five and ten groups).
There is a set pattern to the dishes: typically olives, tahini, salad and yogurt will be followed by dishes with vegetables and eggs, then small meat or fish dishes alongside special accompaniments, and finally more substantial dishes such as whole fish or meat stews and grills.
Establishments will offer their own specialities, but the pattern remains the same.
Naturally the dishes served will reflect the seasons.
For example, in late autumn, snails will be prominent.
As so much food is offered, it is not expected that every dish be finished, but rather shared at will and served at ease.
Eating a Cypriot meze is a social event.
It works by generating methemoglobin.

Some observers have framed the WHO as being unable to risk antagonising the Chinese government, as otherwise the agency would not have been able stay informed on the domestic state of the outbreak and influence response measures there, after which there would have "likely have been a raft of articles criticizing the WHO for needlessly offending China at a time of crisis and hamstringing its own ability to operate." Through this, experts such as Dr David Nabarro have defended this strategy in order "to ensure Beijing's co-operation in mounting an effective global response to the outbreak".
Osman Dar, director of the One Health Project at the Chatham House Centre on Global Health Security defended the WHO's conduct, stating that the same pressure was one "that UN organisations have always had from the advanced economies."

Upright posts would presumably be fixed permanently in that place, and the crossbeam, with the condemned person perhaps already nailed to it, would then be attached to the post.

Jan Van Dijk (2006) defines the network society as a "social formation with an infrastructure of social and media networks enabling its prime mode of organization at all levels (individual, group / organizational and societal).
Increasingly, these networks link all units or parts of this formation (individuals, groups and organizations) "(Van Dijk 2006: 20).
For Van Dijk networks have become the nervous system of society, whereas Castells links the concept of the network society to capitalist transformation, Van Dijk sees it as the logical result of the increasing widening and thickening of networks in nature and society.
Darin Barney uses the term for characterizing societies that exhibit two fundamental characteristics: "The first is the presence in those societies of sophisticated – almost exclusively digital – technologies of networked communication and information management / distribution, technologies which form the basic infrastructure mediating an increasing array of social, political and economic practices.
The second, arguably more intriguing, characteristic of network societies is the reproduction and institutionalization throughout (and between) those societies of networks as the basic form of human organization and relationship across a wide range of social, political and economic configurations and associations.

At times the gibbet was only one vertical stake, called in Latin crux simplex.
This was the simplest available construction for torturing and killing the condemned.
Frequently, however, there was a cross-piece attached either at the top to give the shape of a T (crux commissa) or just below the top, as in the form most familiar in Christian symbolism (crux immissa).
Jehovah's Witnesses argue that Jesus was crucified on a crux simplex, and that the crux immissa was an invention of Emperor Constantine. Other forms were in the shape of the letters X and Y. Apparently the most ancient image of a Roman crucifixion is a graffito found in a taberna (hostel for wayfarers) in Puteoli, dating to the time of Trajan or Hadrian (late 1st century to early 2nd century AD).
The cross is the T shape.

Knowledge of inosine metabolism has led to advances in immunotherapy in recent decades.
Inosine monophosphate is oxidised by the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, yielding xanthosine monophosphate, a key precursor in purine metabolism.
Mycophenolate mofetil is an anti-metabolite, anti-proliferative drug that acts as an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase.
It is used in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases including granulomatosis with polyangiitis because the uptake of purine by actively dividing B cells can exceed 8 times that of normal body cells, and, therefore, this set of white cells (which can not operate purine salvage pathways) is selectively targeted by the purine deficiency resulting from inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMD) inhibition.

These critics argue that contemporary society first of all is still a capitalist society oriented towards accumulating economic, political, and cultural capital.
They acknowledge that information society theories stress some important new qualities of society (notably globalization and informatization), but charge that they fail to show that these are attributes of overall capitalist structures.
Critics such as Webster insist on the continuities that characterise change.
In this way Webster distinguishes between different epochs of capitalism: laissez - faire capitalism of the 19th century, corporate capitalism in the 20th century, and informational capitalism for the 21st century (kasiwulaya 2006).
One of González's most well known and earliest works depicts a young couple standing holding hands with one other and a bouquet of flowers with a slight smile on their faces.
This painting was based off a photo that originally appeared in the press of a couple who commissioned a professional photographer to take their portrait before jumping off the dam of the Sisga on the outskirts of Bogotá.
The couple were two young farmers who were deeply in love, but in an effort to preserve the purity of their love, the man (who was suspected to be mentally insane) convinced his girlfriend to commit suicide as a way to show their religious devotion in not wanting to sully the woman's purity.
The picture was sent to their families, and when the news broke it was widely reprinted in black and white in the local newspapers.
González claimed that she was attracted to this picture due to its "bad quality" or more so its plain quality, the simplification of the facial features that were almost deformed by the discrepancy.
This painting was the first of a number of paintings done by González in the 1960s in which she explored the intense violence in Colombia.
During this time she produced a series of ink drawings on the same theme, that were tabloid photos of crimes of passion and political murders as well as advertisements for everything from bodybuilding to headache cures.

This allows organizations to realize continuous improvements in both promotional activities and customer acquisition systems.
Like lead management, customer acquisition management creates an orderly architecture for managing large volumes of customer inquiries, or leads.
In problem - solving contexts, the random - word creativity technique is perhaps the simplest method.
A person confronted with a problem is presented with a randomly generated word, in the hopes of a solution arising from any associations between the word and the problem.
This technique is based on associative thinking, the process of retrieving information from our knowledge and automatically find patterns across elements.
While standard associative thinking generates associations between concepts that are strongly related and not very original, the unpredictability of a random word will lead to explore new associations that would not emerge automatically, and hopefully trigger novel solutions.
A random image, sound, or article can be used instead of a random word as a kind of creativity goad or provocation.

In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers began using the intentions of the parties involved to classify the styles of conflict management that they included in their models.
Both Thomas (1976) and Pruitt (1983) put forth a model based on the concerns of the parties involved in the conflict.
The combination of the parties' concern for their own interests (i.e. assertiveness) and their concern for the interests of those across the table (i.e. cooperativeness) yielded a particular conflict management style.
Pruitt called these styles yielding (low assertiveness / high cooperativeness), problem solving (high assertiveness / high cooperativeness), inaction (low assertiveness / low cooperativeness), and contending (high assertiveness / low cooperativeness).
Pruitt argues that problem - solving is the preferred method when seeking mutually beneficial options (win - win).

The Project 26 class ships were 191.3 m (627ft 7in) long overall.
They had a beam of 17.66 m (57ft 11in) and at full load a draft of 6.15 m (20ft 2in).
They displaced 7,890 tonnes (7,765 long tons) at standard load, and 9,436 tonnes (9,287 long tons) at full load.
Their single rudder meant that they were not very maneuverable. Kirov and Voroshilov were fitted with a massive quadruped foremast, but this proved to restrict the view from the conning tower as well as the fields of fire of the 100 mm anti-aircraft guns and greatly increased their silhouette.
It was reduced to a simple pole mast in the later ships and the superstructure enlarged to accommodate the fire control facilities formerly housed in the foremast.
Other reviews echoed many of the positive aspects of the game.
GamePro stated that "Gearbox has done one hell of a job in creating not just an add - on for Half - Life, but a continuation of a masterpiece", praising both level design and story elements, but noted that it was a little too short.

In the first quarter of 2012, the Polish - Russian border saw the least traffic out of the borders Poland shares with the non-European Union countries (the others being the Poland - Ukraine border and the Poland - Belarus border).
For that period, a majority of the individuals crossing the borders did so for the explicit purpose of short term (usually under one day) shopping; this was the case with 45% of foreigners entering Poland, and 87% of Poles entering Russia.
Compared to traffic on other non-EU Polish borders, a much larger percentage (22% foreigners and 7% Poles) crossed the borders for the purpose of tourism and transit (16.5% foreigners).

The Kirov - class (Project 26) cruisers were a class of six cruisers built in the late 1930s for the Soviet Navy.
After the first two ships, armor protection was increased and subsequent ships are sometimes called the Maxim Gorky class.
These were the first large ships built by the Soviets from the keel up after the Russian Civil War, and they were derived from the Italian cruiserRaimondo Montecuccoli, being designed with assistance from the Italian Ansaldo company.
Two ships each were deployed in the Black and Baltic Seas during World War II, while the last pair was still under construction in the Russian Far East and saw no combat during the war.
The first four ships bombarded Axis troops and facilities after the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.
All six ships survived the war and lingered until the 1970s in training and other secondary roles before being scrapped.

Launching applications: The menu's primary function is to present a list of shortcuts for installed software, allowing users to launch them.
Invoking special folders: Until Windows 8, the Start menu was a mean of invoking special folders such as Computer, Network, Control Panel, etc..
In Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the only special folder that can be invoked from the Start screen is the desktop.
Searching: Starting with Windows Vista, searching for installed software, files and folders became a function of the Start menu.
Windows 10 ended this tradition by moving the search into taskbar.
Ending the user session: Logging off and shutdown has always been a function of the Start menu.
In Windows 8, the shutdown function was moved out of the Start screen, only to be brought back in Windows 8.1 Update (in April 2014) with a sufficiently high screen resolution.

Even though the number of North Korean defectors reached its peak in 1998 and 1999, the estimated population is believed to have declined since then.
Some main reasons for the falling number of defectors especially since 2000 are strict border patrols and inspections, forced deportations, and rising cost for defection. During the mourning period of Kim Jong - il's death on December 17, 2011 and the start of Kim Jong - un's rule, the movements of people were tightened and strictly controlled.
This included requiring familiesthat livenear the border areasto take turns standing guard, having strong official warnings that three generations of a family would be destroyed if caught defecting, as well as having the defector being executed on - site.
The number of North Korean defectors has dramatically decreased as a result.

Special folders: Apart from ordinary files and folders, special folders (also known as "shell folders") may appear on the desktop.
Unlike ordinary folders, special folders do not point to an absolute location on a hard disk drive.
Rather, they may open a folder whose location differs from computer to computer (e.g. Documents), a virtual folder whose contents is an aggregate of several folders on disk (e.g. Recycle Bin or Libraries) or a folder window whose content is not files, but rather user interface elements rendered as icons for convenience (e.g. Network).
They may even open windows that do not resemble a folder at all (e.g. Control Panel).

Limonite, a mixture of various hydrates and polymorphs of ferric oxyhydroxide, is one of the three major iron ores, having been used since at least 2500 BCE.
Multiple studies have confirmed that distraction actually increases creative cognition. One such study done by Jonathan Schooler found that non-demanding distractions improve performance on a classic creativity task called the UUT (Unusual Uses Task) in which the subject must come up with as many possible uses for a common object.
The results confirmed that decision - related neural processes occur during moments of unconscious thought while a person engages in a non-demanding task.
The research showed that while distracted a subject is n't maintaining one thought for a particularly long time, which in turn allows different ideas to float in and out of one's consciousness - this sort of associative process leads to creative incubation.
Of all organizational activities, one study found team - development to have the strongest effect (versus financial measures) for improving organizational performance.

A resection margin or surgical margin is the margin of apparently non-tumerous tissue around a tumor that has been surgically removed, called "resected", in surgical oncology.
The resection is an attempt to remove a cancer tumor so that no portion of the malignant growth extends past the edges or margin of the removed tumor and surrounding tissue.
These are retained after the surgery and examined microscopically by a pathologist to see if the margin is indeed free from tumor cells.
If cancerous cells are found at the edges the operation is much less likely to achieve the desired results.

Organizational conflict at the interpersonal level includes disputes between peers as well as supervisor - subordinate conflict.
Party - directed mediation (PDM) is a mediation approach particularly suited for disputes between co-workers, colleagues or peers, especially deep - seated interpersonal conflict, multicultural or multiethnic disputes.
The mediator listens to each party separately in a pre-caucus or pre-mediation before ever bringing them into a joint session.
Part of the pre-caucus also includes coaching and role plays.
The idea is that the parties learn how to converse directly with their adversary in the joint session.
Some unique challenges arise when organizational disputes involve supervisors and subordinates.
The Negotiated Performance Appraisal (NPA) is a tool for improving communication between supervisors and subordinates and is particularly useful as an alternate mediation model because it preserves the hierarchical power of supervisors while encouraging dialogue and dealing with differences in opinion.
The 2002 Women's Health Initiative (WHI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found disparate results for all cause mortality with HRT, finding it to be lower when HRT was begun earlier, between age 50 to 59, but higher when begun after age 60.
In older patients, there was an increased incidence of breast cancer, heart attacks and stroke, although a reduced incidence of colorectal cancer and bone fracture. Some of the WHI findings were again found in a larger national study done in the United Kingdom, known as the Million Women Study (MWS). As a result of these findings, the number of women taking HRT dropped precipitously.
The WHI recommended that women with non-surgical menopause take the lowest feasible dose of HRT for the shortest possible time to minimize associated risks.

The gibbet on which crucifixion was carried out could be of many shapes.
Josephus describes multiple tortures and positions of crucifixion during the Siege of Jerusalem as Titus crucified the rebels; and Seneca the Younger recounts: "I see crosses there, not just of one kind but made in many different ways: some have their victims with head down to the ground; some impale their private parts; others stretch out their arms on the gibbet."

As of today, 80 - 90% of North Korean defectors residing in China are females who settled through de facto marriage; a large number of them experience forced marriage and human trafficking.

Alain Touraine already spoke in 1971 of the post-industrial society.
"The passage to postindustrial society takes place when investment results in the production of symbolic goods that modify values, needs, representations, far more than in the production of material goods or even of 'services'.
Industrial society had transformed the means of production: post-industrial society changes the ends of production, that is, culture.
(…) The decisive point here is that in postindustrial society all of the economic system is the object of intervention of society upon itself.
That is why we can call it the programmed society, because this phrase captures its capacity to create models of management, production, organization, distribution, and consumption, so that such a society appears, at all its functional levels, as the product of an action exercised by the society itself, and not as the outcome of natural laws or cultural specificities "(Touraine 1988: 104).
In the programmed society also the area of cultural reproduction including aspects such as information, consumption, health, research, education would be industrialized.
That modern society is increasing its capacity to act upon itself means for Touraine that society is reinvesting ever larger parts of production and so produces and transforms itself.
This makes Touraine's concept substantially different from that of Daniel Bell who focused on the capacity to process and generate information for efficient society functioning.

For Stehr, the economy of a knowledge society is largely driven not by material inputs, but by symbolic or knowledge - based inputs (Ibid.: 67), there would be a large number of professions that involve working with knowledge, and a declining number of jobs that demand low cognitive skills as well as in manufacturing (Stehr 2002a).

After ingestion, inosine is metabolized into uric acid, which has been suggested to be a natural antioxidant and peroxynitrite scavenger with potential benefits to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).
Peroxynitrite has been correlated with axon degeneration.
In 2003, a study was initiated at the University of Pennsylvania MS Center to determine whether raising the levels of uric acid by the administration of inosine would slow the progression of MS. The study was completed in 2006 but the results were not reported to NIH.

In addition, the side effect of the treatment was the development of kidney stones in four of 16 patients.
Thus, additional studies are necessary to prove the treatment's efficacy.

International conflict management
The district and commune level instigators created their own brutal and lawless way of organizing the massacres in their areas.
Prior to the executions they would often hold a short "trial" (lasting only a few minutes) in the lawlessly created "Supreme Court of the Poor and Lower - middle Peasants".
The "judges" were unsurprisingly the local leaders who prearranged the killings.
If the victims were sentenced to death (and they almost always were amid the corruption and lawlessness), they were trussed up by armed militia and taken to a mass rally for denouncing their "crimes."
Then, they were killed in public or by the public.
Sometimes the local CCP and militia officials considered that it might be dangerous to take the victims to the public.
They would then quietly send a team of armed militia to the victims' homes to carry out the slaughter.
The victims would often be informed while away from home that an issue had risen requiring them to return, in order to lure the victims back home where their killers would be waiting.
Victims were killed in a number of ways, ranging from shooting to beating to decapitation.
Those directly involved in the "executions" were rewarded for their work with higher salaries than they earned by their regular employment in the commune or district, an incentive that was a major factor for the high number of people who participated in the killings; a number of local CCP and militia officials personally led the killings.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the lack of law enforcement, local criminals also joined in the violence.
Most of those in the militias were social outcasts and little respected people who sought to earn honor by participating in the killings.

Leaving the ring in for three weeks slowly releases hormones into the body, mainly vaginally administered estrogens and / or progestogens (a group of hormones including progesterone) - the same hormones used in birth control pills.
These hormones work mostly by stopping ovulation and thickening the cervical mucus, creating a barrier preventing sperm from fertilizing an egg.
Worn continuously for three weeks followed by a week off, each vaginal ring provides one month of birth control.
For continuous - use contraception, users can also choose to wear the vaginal ring for the full four week cycle.
This manner of contraception will eliminate monthly periods.
Throughout the additional week, the serum hormone levels will remain in the contraceptive range.

In the Sénarmont prism the s - polarized ray (i.e., the ray with polarization direction perpendicular to the plane in which all rays are contained, called the plane of incidence) passes through without being deflected, while the p - polarized ray (with polarization direction in the plane of incidence) is deflected (refracted) at the internal interface into a different direction.
Both rays correspond to ordinary rays (o - rays) in the first component prism, since both polarization directions are perpendicular to the optical axis, which is the propagation direction.
In the second component prism the s - polarized ray remains ordinary (o - ray, polarized perpendicular to the optical axis), while the p - polarized ray becomes extraordinary (e-ray), with a polarization component along the optical axis.
As a consequence, the s - polarized ray is not deflected since the effective refractive index does not change across the interface.
The p - polarized wave, on the other hand, is refracted because the effective refractive index changes upon changing from o - ray to e-ray.

Computer and Video Games reviewer Kim Randell noted that "Gearbox has obviously gone to great pains to provide a similar experience to the original".
Erik Wolpaw, writing for GameSpot, noted that as most expansion packs were mediocre, "it's appropriate that Gearbox Software's Opposing Force, the official expansion for the genre - redefining Half - Life, in turn sets a new standard of quality for future action - game mission packs".
Wolpaw praised the design of the single - player campaign, commenting that "you can sense the designers' enthusiasm as one memorable scene unfolds after another, and it compels you to keep playing".
Although criticizing some elements of the game's artificial intelligence and describing some of the new models as "merely window dressing", the review concluded that Opposing Force was an "impassioned application of creative design".

The history of the border between Poland and Russia can be traced to the early history of both nations, with one of the earliest notable incidents being the Polish king Boleslaw I's intervention in the Kievan succession crisis, 1018.
Following the formation of the Polish - Lithuanian Commonwealth, Poland's eastern border, most of it with the Tsardom of Muscovy (later, the Russian Empire), stretched from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south.
During the period of partitions of Poland, which shifted the Russian borders some 300 miles (480 km) west, several small Polish statelets such as the Duchy of Warsaw and the Congress Kingdom shared a border with the Russian Empire.
Following World War I, the new Second Polish Republic shared a border with the Soviet Union (USSR), shaped during the Polish - Soviet War, and confirmed at the Treaty of Riga at the line Dzisna - Dokshytsy - Słucz - Korets - Ostroh - Zbrucz.
That border was 1,407 kilometres (874mi) long.
Following World War II, the new border (see territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II) was drawn between the People's Republic of Poland and the USSR.
The new Polish - Soviet border was 1,321 kilometres (821mi) long at first, and subject to a minor modification in the 1951 Polish - Soviet territorial exchange, which reduced the border length to 1,244 kilometres (773mi).

Chiziane's writing has often been defined as political and feminist.
Writing for this author is a mission.
It is a way to express the difficulties that women encounter when faced with the heterogeneity of Mozambican cultural traditions and the newly developed legal and administrative systems.
Chiziane's writing addresses regional differences in cultural and political aspects of gender relations.
In her novel Niketche, for instance, she depicts the Mozambican South as dominated by a patriarchal culture, whereas the North is shaped by traditions of matriarchal rule. She also alludes to the fact that Frelimo itself assumed an ambiguous attitude with regard to polygamy, making it illegal at first, but then tolerating its continuing practice.
Throughout her work, Chiziane's attention has focused on broad social issues related to women's rights and concerns, such as monogamy and polygamy, but also on subjective and intimate relationships between individual men and women.
Chiziane has stated that, in accordance with the tradition of her land, she considers herself a storyteller rather than a novelist.

In addition, Liu claimed that a number of people under the Five Black Categories "in Dao County" had plotted to kill all Communist party members and poor - and lower - middle peasant leaders in the county.
"Liu Shibing, along with Xiong Binen, Deputy - Secretariat of the Dao County CCP Committee, ordered all levels of militia personnel and security officers to start an urgent preemptive attack against the class enemies.
Although they did not specifically state the word "kill", all levels of party leadership understood the meaning of this strong signal.
There is no doubt that those government officials at the highest county rank were the decision - makers.
They not only manufactured an imminent threat to justify the approaching massacre but instructed their subordinates to execute the killing as well.
The WHO's daily situation reports recognise Taiwan as a part of China, with the result of Taiwan receiving the same "very high" risk rating as the mainland by the WHO despite only a having a relatively small number of cases on the ROC - governed island.
This has led to Taiwan receiving travel bans from other countries.
Furthermore, as Taiwan has been excluded from the WHO due to pressure from Beijing after the Tsai's 2016 election, the state may be vulnerable in the case of an outbreak in that territory without proper channels to the WHO.
In response, the WHO has said that they "have Taiwanese experts involved in all of our consultations... so they're fully engaged and fully aware of all of the developments in the expert networks." After urging from Japan, the US and the UK, Taiwan was granted participation with Beijing's agreement, who deemed it "necessary under the circumstances to let Taiwan participate in sharing information on the virus."
Taiwan has called the move a "meaningful development" in response.
Some Taiwanese political observers have viewed such criticism of the WHO as "more politics than real needs," suggesting that "even though we are not in WHO, we can still get this info from many, many other places."

Pholcodine is slowly biotransformed in the body via oxidation and conjugation to a series of metabolites that are eliminated primarily in the urine.
With an average half - life of approximately 2.3 days, steady - state in someone taking the drug chronically would not be reached for nearly 2 weeks.
Nearly one - half of a single dose is eventually excreted as free or conjugated parent drug.
The most important urinary metabolite is conjugated morphine, which may be detectable for days or weeks after the last dose.

The binary star, which has a period of about 16 days, is also variable, probably due to dust in orbit around it.
The dust itself is heated by the central star and so NGC 2346 is unusually bright in the infrared part of the spectrum.
When one of the two stars evolved into a red giant, it engulfed its companion, which stripped away a ring of material from the larger star's atmosphere.
When the red giant's core was exposed, a fast stellar wind inflated two ‘ bubbles' from either side of the ring.

The major critique of concepts such as information society, postmodern society, knowledge society, network society, postindustrial society, etc. that has mainly been voiced by critical scholars is that they create the impression that we have entered a completely new type of society.
"If there is just more information then it is hard to understand why anyone should suggest that we have before us something radically new" (Webster 2002a: 259).
Critics such as Frank Webster argue that these approaches stress discontinuity, as if contemporary society had nothing in common with society as it was 100 or 150 years ago.
Such assumptions would have ideological character because they would fit with the view that we can do nothing about change and have to adapt to existing political realities (kasiwulaya 2002b: 267).

The goal of the game is to uncover all the squares that do not contain mines without being "blown up" by clicking on a square with a mine underneath.
The location of the mines is discovered by a process of logic.
Clicking on the game board will reveal what is hidden underneath the chosen square or squares (a large number of blank squares may be revealed in one go if they are adjacent to each other).
Some squares are blank but some contain numbers (1 to 8), each number being the number of mines adjacent to the uncovered square.
To help avoid hitting a mine, the location of a suspected mine can be marked by flagging it with the right mouse button. The game is won once all blank squares have been uncovered without hitting a mine, any remaining mines not identified by flags being automatically flagged by the computer.
However, in the event that a game is lost and the player mistakenly flags a safe square, that square will either appear with a red X covering the mine (denoting it as safe), or just a red X (also denoting it as safe).
The game board comes in three set sizes: beginner, intermediate, and expert, though a custom option is available as well.

The Hyades Stream (or Hyades moving group) is a large collection of scattered stars that also share a similar trajectory with the Hyades Cluster.
In 1869, Richard A. Proctor observed that numerous stars at large distances from the Hyades share a similar motion through space.
In 1908, Lewis Boss reported almost 25 years of observations to support this premise, arguing for the existence of a co-moving group of stars that he called the Taurus Stream (now generally known as the Hyades Stream or following Olin J. Eggen who assumed that it was a vestige of an initially more massive cluster which had partly evaporated, the Hyades Supercluster).
Boss published a chart that traced the scattered stars movements back to a common point of convergence.

Internal policy discussions on talk pages can often become long - winded, too, usually for two reasons: because of the detailed nature of Wikipedia policies and guidelines (and their often complicated interaction with each other), and because curt and questionable assertions of policy rationales (especially when many are made in series in a single post) may require a fairly detailed response.
The cure for this problem is to make a clear, policy - related statement to begin with, and avoid citing more policy and guideline pages than are necessary to get the point across (many say the same thing in slightly different wording).
If you cite five such pages in vague terms for the same point, you open the door to wikilawyering about wording and interpretation - you may get five paragraphs of rebuttal in response instead of one sentence of agreement.

Loeys - Dietz syndrome (LDS) is an autosomal dominant genetic connective tissue disorder.
It has features similar to Marfan syndrome and Ehlers - Danlos syndrome.
The disorder is marked by aneurysms in the aorta, often in children, and the aorta may also undergo sudden dissection in the weakened layers of the wall of the aorta.
Aneurysms and dissections also can occur in arteries other than the aorta.
Because aneurysms in children tend to rupture early, children are at greater risk for dying if the syndrome is not identified.
Surgery to repair aortic aneurysms is essential for treatment.
Approximately 600 Jews were killed in Greater Albania during the Holocaust.
In Albania - proper, five Jews from the same family were killed by the Germans, the only native Jews to be killed there over the course of the war.
Albania - proper emerged from the war with a population of Jews eleven times greater than at the beginning, numbering around 1,800.
Most of these subsequently emigrated to Israel.
Several hundred remained in Albania until the fall of Communism in the early 1990s before doing the same.
There is no academic consensus as to why Jewish survival rates in Albania - proper differed so drastically from those in Kosovo.
Some scholars have argued that the traditional code of honour known as besa, an important part of the culture of Albania - proper, played a role.
Other academics have suggested the cause was the relative lenience of the Italian occupational authorities, Germany's failure to seek out Jews in Albania - proper as thoroughly as in other countries, as well as the Kosovo Albanians' distrust of foreigners.
As of 2018, 75 citizens of Albania had been recognized by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations.

At the end of the twentieth century, the concept of the network society gained importance in information society theory.
For Manuel Castells, network logic is besides information, pervasiveness, flexibility, and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm (2000a: 69ff).
"One of the key features of informational society is the networking logic of its basic structure, which explains the use of the concept of 'network society'" (Castells 2000: 21).
As an historical trend, dominant functions and processes in the Information Age are increasingly organized around networks.
Networks constitute the new social morphology of our societies, and the diffusion of networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production, experience, power, and culture "(Castells 2000: 500).
For Castells the network society is the result of informationalism, a new technological paradigm.

In rapidly growing developing economies like India where the demand for international consumer products is growing much faster than in - country supply from authorized distributors, direct imports become the only way for consumers to procure a large set of products (especially long tail).
In many cases, even if a particular product is available from an authorized middle - man, a direct import may cost much less since in - country middlemen use their exclusive territorial rights to price products much higher than in the country of origin.
Perversely, in countries where such product and price arbitrage is the most obvious, the import process is typically very onerous and not easily navigated by the average consumer leaving the field open to predatory pricing from in - country middlemen.

Have her pull herself in close by nestling in your arms.
You can gently squeeze her legs and back, bringing her body closer to your body.
When carrying a heavy object, keep your back, shoulders, and neck straight.
Try to consciously bring your shoulders back when carrying a girl, straightening out your back.
You may stumble a bit as you carry a person, but try to do your best to keep your body straight.
Imagine a vertical line is drawn between your ankles and the tip of your head.
You do not want to drop a person you are carrying.
This can cause injury.
For added safety, ask that the girl hold onto you.
She can gently wrap her arms around your shoulders for support.
As most people weigh over 100 pounds, carrying a person can be strenuous work.
Only carry a girl as long as you feel comfortable.
When you begin to feel strain in your muscles, gently put the girl down.
Squat slightly, lowering your body with your legs and not your back.
Lower the arm that's holding her legs, allowing her to safely place her feet onto solid ground.
Help her stand back upright if she stumbles at all while you're putting her down.
Brushing your teeth is by far the most effective way of removing plaque, and brushing properly and regularly will help to ensure that less plaque builds up over time.
This is important as built - up plaque can calcify into tartar, which is a lot harder to remove.
You should brush your teeth once a day at the very least, but dentists recommend brushing twice; once in the morning and once before bed.
It is important to brush before bed because during night, bacterial flora becomes more active eliminating acids that are hard to neutralize because of the reduced flow of saliva.
Flossing is an essential component of effective oral hygiene, though unfortunately it is often neglected.
Flossing removes bacteria and food particles from between the teeth, helping to prevent the formation of plaque.
It should be done once a day, at bedtime, before brushing your teeth.
Floss between teeth using a gentle sawing motion, and lifting the floss along the sides of the teeth.
Avoid "snapping" the floss into place, as this can irritate the delicate gum tissue.
Make sure to use a clean section of floss for between each tooth, otherwise you are just moving bacteria from one part of your mouth to another.
If you find dental floss awkward to use, try using a dental pick instead.
This is a small wooden or plastic stick which can be inserted between the teeth, achieving the same results as flossing.
Though plaque - busting mouthwashes are not effective enough to remove plaque all by themselves, when used as part of a teeth cleaning routine involving brushing and flossing, they can help to loosen plaque, while giving you minty - fresh breath in the process.
Chlorhexidine digluconate is the most effective mouthwash against any type of oral bacteria, but it should not be used for more than two weeks in a row.
The bacteria found in plaque thrive on sugary and starchy foods.
In fact, every time you eat these kinds of foods, the bacteria release an acid which leads to tooth decay and cavities.
To avoid this, try to minimize your consumption of these types of processed foods and pay special attention to your brushing and flossing routine if you decide to indulge.
Even if you implement the most rigorous oral hygiene routine at home, you can still benefit from a visit to the dentist every six months or so.
Only a dentist can give you the thorough, professional cleaning which will remove the most hard - to - reach plaque and stubborn tartar.
Making eye contact is a great way to show you're interested in a girl and to judge her interest.
Whenever you feel it's appropriate, try meeting her gaze for a moment.
However, do n't stare too long as this may make her uncomfortable.
Try to meet her eyes for as long as you feel is appropriate to get her attention.
Remember to wear a friendly look on your face, offering a smile.
Try not to glance away quickly as this might make you seem un-confident or nervous.
If you've caught her gaze for a few moments, you might want to make a playful gesture.
This can be something simple such as making a silly face or sticking your tongue out.
Playing around like this can demonstrate your confidence and interest to her.
It's important that you feel and represent yourself as being friendly, open, and approachable.
You want to convey that you are confident, comfortable, and have a kind personality.
Use your smile to break the ice and make a good impression on the girl that you like.
Do n't force your smile.
Let your genuine happiness show through.
Do n't put on a big grin or smile too long.
This can cause you too look disingenuous or strange.
Use the right kind of toothbrush and toothpaste.
Use the correct brushing technique.
Focus on each tooth individually.
Remember to brush your tongue.
Getting a girl's attention and making an impression is much easier to do when you've surrounded yourself with others.
If she sees you as being the center of attention, she may become curious about you, wondering what draws people to you.
Try surrounding yourself with friends and getting along with those around you to catch her interest.
Try meeting with your friends just before or after the class starts.
Be somewhere in the class that she can see you and how well you are engaging with your friends.
You might try walking into the class with your friends while you are telling a great story.
If you want to make a good impression, it's always a good idea to treat others around you well.
Chances are, if a girl is interested in you, she will be judging how you treat other people to get an idea of how you might treat her.
Make it a point to show your character by supporting those around you in class.
Try complimenting good ideas that come up in class.
Avoid saying anything negative or sarcastic to others.
Remember to thank others who help you during class.
Always speak supportively and kindly to those around you to help make a good impression.
If you want to get the attention of the girl you like, you will need to make yourself stand out during class.
Sitting quietly and taking notes wo n't get anyone's attention.
Make sure your questions are actually aimed at furthering the topic under discussion.
Do n't make inappropriate jokes during the class.
Women are generally attracted to men who appear more dominant and confident.
To show how confident you are, you can try to establish your space whenever you are around a girl you like.
Simply taking up whatever space you need can be a good way to get her attention.
When you sit down, feel free to relax and take up whatever space you'd like.
For example, you might try extending your arm over an empty chair that you are sitting next to.
Stretching your arms up into the air can be a good idea.
Try to avoid being too aggressive or obnoxious.
Make yourself comfortable, but not if it means making others uncomfortable.
There are few things more attractive than a person who is happy, joyful, and having fun.
People are naturally interested in sharing in good times with others.
Enjoying yourself can be a simple and easy way to make an impression.
Talk about an exciting idea or project you and friend are working on.
Let your enthusiasm show to help catch her attention.
Try sharing a joke with your friends before class starts.
Make sure you say it loud enough so she can hear it.
Talk with your friends about something exciting you have planned, such as going to a concert or going on a trip.
Even though you have n't spoken with the girl you are interested in, you might still learn a few things that she is interested in.
Knowing what she likes can help you steer your conversations and actions in a direction that can make an impression.
You may have noticed that she was reading a book about a certain artist.
You can try asking a question about that artist during your art class to show your interest.
Maybe she carries a backpack with her favorite band on it.
You might try bringing up that band's genre during a music history course.
Try talking about something you know she likes with your friends during class.
If you have chronic gum boils, or gum boils that are cosmetically embarrassing, you may want to consider getting them surgically removed.
This can greatly increase the chance of the boil not returning again.
You'll need to speak with a gum specialist, such as a periodontist, about this option to see what they recommend.
Your dentist or gum specialist may recommend simply draining the boil instead of surgically removing it, depending on the location of the boil and how complicated it would be to remove it.
In this case they will give you antibiotics to take for at least five days after draining.
Many gum boils are caused by active gum disease or some other kind of periodontal disease that leads to periodontal abscesses.
If this is the case for you, it may be important to get a deep cleaning from your dentist in order to remove any active bacteria from the inside of your mouth that could be contributing to the gum boil.
If this seems to help, you'll want to be sure to continue with regular visits for cleanings to help keep your oral bacteria levels down and to maintain your overall oral health.
Consider gum surgery if your periodontist decides it is the best way to prevent future infections or gum boils Some gum boils are caused by dental abscesses.
In these cases, root canal therapy would be required to remove the bacteria and decayed enamel from the area.
Once the root canal is performed, a crown or filling is inserted and sealed to protect the tooth and the mouth from further infection.
Root canals can be quite expensive and require multiple visits to perform, so make sure you look into the cost before you agree to the surgery.
When you have the basic idea down and have a plan for how it will be laid out, the next to think about is how you're going to build it.
The options seem endless, and people will try to sell you this or that 'fantastic' application, and every other thing that you "absolutely must have" on your site, however the reality is that there are a few great tools for building websites, and one of them will be best - suited to your situation and needs.
This is the first option.
If you have a website - building application like Adobe Dreamweaver, it is not very difficult to create a website from scratch.
You might need to do some coding but do n't panic!
HTML looks complicated, but it's like listening to Shakespeare - it's hard at first, but once you get the feel of it, it's not that difficult.
Pros: website design software simplifies the process of building sites by letting you drag - and - drop images, text, buttons, movies, and anything else you can think of, usually without ever having to dig into HTML.
Many web design applications will even let you create sites specifically for your smart phone or pad.
If you are building a basic, personal website, this is really a great way to go.
Cons: there is a learning curve, and though you do n't have to dig into HTML, it's not totally geek - free.
If you are in a hurry, this might not be the best solution.
Perhaps the biggest con, though, is that if you are not a graphic designer, you could end up with a page that hurts the eyes.
To mollify this somewhat, there are a number of free templates in the applications, and on the internet, but be aware of your limitations - if you have any!
This is the second option.
WordPress is an example of a great option for building websites.
It helps you create web pages and blog posts quickly and easily, set up the menus, allow and manage user comments, and has thousands of themes and plugins that you can choose from and use for free.
Drupal and Joomla are other great CMS options.
Once the CMS is hosted, you can manage your site from anywhere (in the world) that has an Internet connection.
Pros: Very easy to use, quick to get started with one click install, and lots of options for the beginner (with enough depth for more experienced users).
Cons: Some themes are limiting, and not all are free.
This is the third option.
If you decide to build your website from scratch, you'll need to start using HTML and CSS.
There are ways to extend your HTML skills and add more features and more depth to your website.
If you are developing a professional website, these tools will help you get that edge that is needed in any business venture.
CSS, which stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".
CSS gives more flexibility for styling the HTML, and makes it much easier to make basic changes - fonts, headers, color schemes - in one place, and have those changes ripple through the site.
XHTML is a web language set by W3C's standards.
Almost identical to HTML, it follows a stricter set of rules for marking up information.
What this means, for the most part, is minor changes to the way you write code.
Look into HTML5.
It's the fifth revision of the core HTML standard, and will eventually subsume the current version of HTML (HTML4), and XHTML as well.
Learn a client - side scripting language, such as JavaScript.
This will increase your ability to add interactive elements to your site, such as charts, maps, etc..
Learn a server - side scripting language.
PHP, ASP with JavaScript or VB Script or Python can be used to change the way web pages appear to different people, and lets you edit or create forums.
They can also help store information about people who visit your site, like their username, settings, and even temporary "shopping carts" for commercial sites.
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique of using a browser sided language and a server sided language to make the page get new information from the server without refreshing the page, often greatly reducing user wait time and vastly improving the user's experience but increasing bandwidth usage.
For a website that will see a lot of traffic, or an eCommerce site, this is an excellent solution.
This is the fourth and final option.
If you are not up to designing your own website, or learning new coding languages - especially for more advanced sites - hiring a professional may be your best option.
Before you hire, ask to see a portfolio of their work, and check their references carefully.
Paint comes pre-installed on your PC.
Press ⊞ Win + S to open the search box and type paint.
When you see "Paint" appear in the search results, click on it.
Make sure the image is on your computer.
Click the "File" menu and select "Open."
Locate your image and click "OK." "
A list of image types, including JPEG, will appear.
This will launch a new box which allows you to choose a folder, rename the file, and select a 'Save as type.'
Navigate to a folder you'll recall later and make sure 'JPEG' is selected as the 'Save as type.'
Your file has been converted.
Hashtags help you to get discovered by other users and your photos are more likely to get liked.
Using a lot of hashtags increases the likelihood that your photos will be viewed and shared.
For example, if you have a picture of your wiener dog, possible hashtags you can use are #wienerdog, #dog, and #pet.
Some of the most popular hashtags are #love, #me, #cute, #friday and #coffee.
Keep in mind that using a popular hashtag can also make your photo more likely to be lost.
Also, you can go to #likeforlike or #like4like and like a lot of photos.
Not everyone likes back, but at least you get some likes.
That last 1/3 of a tank may last you a bit longer than the first third did.
That being said, it's generally true that gas prices spike up on the weekends, starting on Thursday afternoons.
So if you think you'll need gas on Saturday, it might be wise to fill up now.
Scope out any especially good gas prices to see if it's worth buying now.
If you idle your car for more than a minute, it will save gas to turn off the engine.
Also, new cars do not need to be "warmed up" on a cold winter day – a couple of seconds should do the trick.
Whenever you're waiting for someone, turn off the idle.
Drive thru or going inside?
Going inside.
You can still play the radio without idling!
When you turn the hose off, there's still all that gas in the line.
To get that last 1/2 cup of gas (that's 4 ounces of free gas! , , turn the nozzle upside - down and give it a shake before you take it out of your tank
Lift up the hose a bit to get the gas resting in the line.
Gravity causes the gas to lie at the lowest point, so lifting it up gets it out of there and into your tank.
The better cooling method at freeway speeds depends on your car.
Rolling down the windows creates drag, and using the air conditioning causes your engine to work harder.
However, rolling down the windows is okay in city traffic.
The cooler your car is, the less gas will evaporate from your tank.
And did we mention that your bum does n't get seared on contact?
It's better for your car and for you.
It's hard to drive when you ca n't touch the steering wheel without burning yourself!
Fuel economy is worse in busy, high - traffic times or when it is raining, windy or when barometric pressure is high.
Rain, headwind and high barometric pressure create extra air drag that uses more fuel to create and maintain forward motion.
Which direction is the wind coming from?
It should come as no surprise that high - traffic times are not good for fuel efficiency.
You're stopping and starting, idling, weaving, and probably taking part in just about every bad habit for your fuel economy.
Sure, when we cut the engine, everything goes off, but what about when we start it back up?
If you turn everything off, the next time you start up your car, it'll take way less gas to get everything going.
[citation needed] You can then turn everything on one at a time, which is much easier for your car to handle.
Try to consolidate errands and appointments.
Get all your errands done in one go to increase your free time, too.
You can also plan your trip on certain days to avoid traffic and paying higher gas prices the next week.
For example, buy non-perishable necessities (including pet food, toilet needs, dry goods, and canned groceries, etc.) in bulk so you do n't have to make a special trip for a few items.
Many herbs have been as emmenagogues for centuries.
People often believe herbs to be harmless, but they can have side effects that are just as significant as any other type of medication.
If you want to try using herbs to bring on your period, it is best to speak with your doctor first.
Conduct research and make sure you take no more than the recommended dosage, as some herbs are poisonous at high levels.
Some emmenagogues are also abortifacients, meaning they could cause your body to miscarry if you are pregnant.
If there is any chance that pregnancy is the reason your period has n't come, do not attempt to terminate the pregnancy using herbs.
This can be extremely dangerous.
Be especially careful if you already have a medical condition.
Herbs could exacerbate your condition or cause dangerous side effects.
Vitamin C is thought to be an emmenagogue.
This is another word for a substance that helps induce your period.
Some find that taking vitamin C supplements or eating food high in vitamin C makes the uterus contract, bringing on a period.
The recommended daily value of vitamin C is 60 mg.
If you decide to take supplements, be sure not to exceed the recommended dosage.
Try eating plenty of papaya, bell peppers, broccoli, kiwi, citrus fruits, leafy greens, and tomatoes.
According to folklore, parsley can be used to induce a period.
Flat and curly - leaf parsley contain apiol and myristicin, substances that are thought to cause the uterus to contract slightly.
To enjoy parsley tea: Wash and chop 1/4 cup of fresh parsley.
The fresh variety contains more nutrients than dried parsley, and it makes better - tasting tea.
Boil a cup of water.
Pour the water over the parsley and let it steep for five minutes.
Strain out the parsley and drink the tea.
Turmeric is thought to relieve menstrual pain and promote period regulation.
Turmeric is a flavorful root that is often used as a cooking spice.
It can also be made into a healthful drink.
Scientists have not confirmed that it can help bring on a period, but it may be worth a try if your period is late.
Sprinkle turmeric over rice, steamed vegetables and other dishes you cook during times when you want to induce your period.
To make it into a drink, add 1 teaspoon turmeric to a cup of water.
Flavor it with lemon and honey, then pour over ice.
Because supplements are not regulated by the FDA, they should be taken with caution.
Speak with your doctor before incorporating supplements into your lifestyle.
Read the instructions on the packaging and take no more than the recommended dosage.
These supplements are thought to be beneficial for inducing your period: Dong Quai.
Used for hundreds of years to help bring on menstrual bleeding, black cohosh promotes the regulation of the entire menstrual cycle and contributes specifically to the shedding of the uterine lining.
White peony moves the blood in the pelvic area, an antidote to uterine "stagnation" during the absence of a period.
Post photos at the right time.
Do n't post photos on Friday or Saturday night.
After you post your photos, comment on a friend's photo.
Know when to call your doctor.
Ask your doctor about lancing.
Take antibiotics only if strongly recommended.
Having your schedule written down is one of the best ways to ensure that you'll keep on track.
If you have easy access to your schedule, you will get in the habit of checking it regularly.
Figure out which method works best for you.
Then you can access your schedule when you need a reminder about what's next on the list.
Some people prefer writing it down in a daily planner.
Others like to keep track on a laptop or tablet.
There are lots of useful scheduling apps for mobile phones.
If you use a computer or phone to record your schedule, you can set reminders to prompt you when important tasks are coming up.
As you start to figure out your daily schedule, break up your day into half - hour segments.
These chunks of time are manageable amounts in which to accomplish certain tasks.
Then you do n't need to plan your schedule down to the minute.
You will have obligations throughout the day that need to be accomplished at specific times.
For example, you need to drop off your children at school at 8:00 a.m..
After you have your obligations worked into your schedule, look for pockets of time that do not require specific activities.
These are considered "flex" time.
Now look at your long - term goals and start to fit activities into your schedule that will help you accomplish your goals.
The flex time can also be used for unforeseen obligations or other activities that come up last - minute.
As you start to adjust to using a schedule, you should consult the schedule frequently.
This will help remind you of your planned activities.
This will also keep you on track so that you do n't spend too much time doing one activity or task.
As you start working through your schedule every day, you can assess how it's working for you.
Make adjustments based on how much time you're spending on different tasks.
Be sure to include your long - term goals so that you are sure to achieve them.
Familiarize yourself with the basics of municipal law.
Understand the enforcement mechanisms of municipal law.
This quick, no - cook recipe is a great go - to choice when you do n't want to spend much time putting your clay together.
All you need are the following supplies: 2 cups cornstarch; 1 cup white school glue; Food coloring (gel or liquid); Bowl
Analyze the relationship from a "dualist" perspective.
Scrutinize the connection from a "monist" perspective.
Determine how nations are required to to conform to international law.
Assess how international law interacts with municipal law.
When questions and conflicts arise in the relationships between sovereign nations, they are solved under the rules of public international law.
This body of law consists of the treaties and legal decisions interpreting those treaties.
International law assumes that all the parties, as sovereign states, are equals.
Conflicts arising under public international law can be settled either through diplomatic negotiations or in the International Court of Justice.
This is the court of the United Nations.
Fifteen judges, elected by the UN General Assembly, use international legal precedent to issue advisory opinions and solve legal disputes between governments.
When citizens of different states have a legal dispute, there is often a question about what law applies.
This choice of law question in civil issues, ranging from contracts to family law, is discussed in the Hague Conference on Private International Law.
In general, courts will first defer to any contract or agreement clauses that identify what courts will have jurisdiction.
In the absence of explicit choice of law language, the court will look to the overall circumstances of the contract, the behavior of the parties in creating the contract (called parol evidence) and if the parties can agree on jurisdiction.
The customary international law is codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
Under this custom, states consistently adhere to certain practices out historical and legal obligation.
Cold porcelain clay is a great alternative to polymer air dry clay for craft projects like clay candle holders, jewelry and other small sculpted items.
It's a delicate clay that shrinks up a bit as it dries.
Here's what you'll need: 1 cup cornstarch 1 cup school grade white glue 2 tablespoons white vinegar 2 tablespoons canola oil Plastic wrap Microwave - safe bowl Extra oil so the clay wo n't stick to your hands
Understand what changing the file extension does.

A vital step to increasing your overall willpower is to take some personal accountability.
Do so for both your successes and obstacles as you work towards your goals.
Talking or writing out loud about your actions can help.
State what you did, why you did it, and how it made you feel.
For example, "I was feeling stressed about getting my paper done, so I decided to distract myself and watch television instead.
I will work on managing my stress better so I can complete my paper so I can get things done instead of feeling lazy and bad about myself.
"Conversely, something like," I wrote two pages of my term paper today because I wanted to stay on task and this makes me feel productive and positive about myself.
"Laying responsibility solely on yourself requires tremendous honesty.
It also increases your ability to manage impulses and "look before you leap," and your sense of responsibility as you cease blaming external factors on your circumstances.
This can help your willpower as you'll embrace the fact change is within your power.
Negative thoughts will inevitably pop up during your journey.
You may take one setback to mean you can never change, or you may simply have a voice in your head, chattering away that you wo n't succeed, putting you down.
If you want to increase willpower, negativity does not help as it makes you feel defeated and hopeless.
While it's impossible to stop negative thoughts completely, you can change how you react and deal with them.
Keep a record of your negative thoughts.
Journaling is beneficial in many ways, and one thing you can do is log the negative thoughts that occur throughout the day.
Soon you will be able to identify any patterns in the negative messages and begin to explore their origins.
When you identify a negative thought, such as "I am not capable of achieving my goals," question whether or not it is really true.
Do this by looking at actual evidence, not just what your negative voice tells you.
You can make two columns in your journal, one with evidence "for" the belief, one "against."
In the "For" column, you might write: "I tried to go a month without eating sugar and I could n't do it.
I feel like I'm not strong enough to change my habit.
"In the" Against "column, you might write" When I set smaller, more attainable goals, I can accomplish them.
When I take things day - by - day or week - by - week, I have a lot of success.
In the past I've met goals to finish school, get a raise at work, and quit smoking.
It was probably unreasonable to quit sugar cold turkey when I love it so much.
I need to try again, maybe using a different method.
"For a more in depth look at negative thoughts and how manage them, check out the article How to Deal with Negative Thoughts.
This means knowing your limits and setting appropriate goals.
If you are trying to quit smoking, for instance, it would of course be great if you could just quit all at once and be done with it.
But maybe that's not you - maybe you still really enjoy smoking and you've been doing it for years.
Instead of holding yourself to an ideal, i.e. someone who can just drop an addictive habit, maybe you need to slowly taper off instead.
In this way you are being true to yourself while also setting yourself up for success by setting goals based on your knowledge of yourself.
It's important to stay on task and take responsibility for your actions.
However, it's also important to know how to reward yourself for good behavior.
No one's willpower is strong enough to keep going without a treat now and then.
Build up a system of rewards for yourself.
If you're trying to lose weight, for example, promise yourself you can buy one new item of clothing for every week you follow your diet and workout schedule.
Everyone has their own system that works for them.
Find something you enjoy and find a way to treat yourself to it now and then.
Working in occasional rewards means you can keep going on your path to your goal longer, resulting in sustained willpower.

Post photos of a pet.
Do n't post excessive pictures of your food.
Combine multiple photos into one shot by using an app like Diptic.
Girly girls do n't run everywhere or flop across their seats.
Practice walking and sitting gracefully.
When you walk, walk carefully and confidently, with small steps and your head held up.
When you sit down, sit with your back straight and your arms by your side or in your lap.
You do n't have to cross your legs or your ankles, but it can add a feminine touch.
Be nice to everyone you meet.
Look them in the eye, introduce yourself if you do n't know them, and address them by name.
Ask how they're doing, and if you are able to help someone with anything, offer to do it!
This does n't mean that you should let people treat you badly -- if you have to tell someone to stop or to leave you alone, do so clearly and firmly.
Avoid swearing or using explicit words.
They're impolite, and it's hard to be girly when you use them.
Girly girls are interested in romance, but that does n't mean you need to start dating or do anything you are n't comfortable with.
Try reading romantic books, watching romances on TV, and talking to your friends about crushes.
Some girls like to read bridal magazines even if they are n't planning to get married.
It's a fun way to show your romantic side and keep up with fashion!
You do n't have to follow every trend, but most girly girls have an idea of what's popular even if they do n't actually participate in it.
You should have an idea of what's cool to wear, listen to, and watch, if only so you'll have something to talk about with your friends.
It's okay to have guy friends, but you should make sure you have a core group of girls that you hang out with and talk about girly things with.
If you do n't have any close girlfriends, start by complimenting one of your classmates on her clothes or makeup.
It's a great way to start a friendship!

Chances are good the dog will not bleed too severely.
Also, dogs feed off the emotional energy of their humans.
If you are upset or panicked, your dog will get excited.
Excitement raises the blood pressure, which leads to more bleeding.
You want to remove the dog from other sources or excitement such as other dogs or noisy people.
Provide a couple of treats and get the dog to sit or lay down, so you can tend to the injury.
Use a dry, clean paper towel, washcloth, pieces of sterile gauze, or any other clean cloth to apply direct pressure to the cut.
At two minutes, you can gently lift the towel or cloth to see if the bleeding has slowed.
After five minutes of pressure, most bleeding should have slowed considerably or stopped.
If you have a commercial clotting aid - the kind you can purchase in the store - pour an ample amount of powder into the palm of one of your hands.
Using a clean fingertip, apply the clotting aid to the wound using gentle pressure.
Repeat until the bleeding stops completely.
If you do n't have a clotting aid, cornstarch, flour, or baby powder will work.
Do not use baking soda or baking powder as they can lead to an infection in the cut.
You can use diluted hydrogen peroxide to remove any dried blood from your dog.
However, do not use this or anything else directly on the wound.
That might disturb the clot and cause bleeding again.
Though you can handle most small ear cuts at home, there are some situations where you should allow your vet to treat the dog.
In these situations, continue to apply pressure to the wound as you transport your dog to the clinic.
The ear may need sutures or other measures to stop the blood flow and ensure the ear heals properly.
Seek a vet's assistance if: There is profuse bleeding The wound goes through the ear The bleeding does n't stop after 10 minutes of home treatment The bleeding keeps restarting The wound is larger than a simple cut
Get inspired.
Choose a topic and purpose.
Draw a flow chart.
Plan for user devices and situations.
Sometimes we can spend so much time worrying about others and how they are feeling that we lose sight of ourselves.
Take responsibility for your own feelings and reactions towards pessimism.
By focusing on your own happiness and less on others, you take the power away from negativity.
Remind yourself that you are in control.
You are in control of how much you let another person's feelings and thoughts affect you.
For example, even though pessimism is hard to listen to, understand that the other person's pessimism is a reflection of themselves and you can only control your own feelings.
You have the power to dictate what affects how you are feeling.
Using logic as a coping resource is associated with higher mental toughness.
Research suggests that optimism may increase mental toughness.
This means that your own optimistic outlook can help you combat pessimism and the spill - over from negativity.
Look for some good in everything and remind yourself that anyone can find flaws in anything when looked at closely enough; what's a lot harder is coming up with solutions and positive actions.
Instead of seeking to persuade the pessimist verbally with upbeat commentary, simply get on with your positive life and let your behavior and actions do all the talking.
If you find yourself feeling down around the pessimist, make a mental list (or even write it down if you wish) of five good things in your life.
Think of the items on this list in your head as a sort of "shield" against negativity if you find yourself reacting to it.
Actively cultivate positive friendships with other optimistic people.
Spending more time around optimists will help raise your mood and reassure you that your state of mind is the right one for you.
The individual's outlook on things is n't her only feature - there are many more complex qualities within a person, so rather than fixating on the negatives, look for the good things.
Is she intelligent?
Is she unique enough not to care what anyone else thinks about her?
Is she good to work with?
Focus on the positive aspects of a person and seek to balance out the negatives.
Just as you might make a list of the five positive things in your life, try to make a list of at least three positive things about your pessimist and run these through your mind when dealing with this person gets tough.
You can also draw on this list to remind the pessimist of what she is good at, in case it seems she has forgotten.
Find compassion for the pessimist in your life by remembering that her pessimism might be rooted in unhappiness or low - self esteem.
When you hear negativity, remind yourself that she may be going through something very difficult that is contributing to her pessimism.
Understand that you do not have control over other people's thoughts or behaviors.
Expect the pessimist to have responsibility for her pessimism.
She may see the negatives, therefore let her own her interpretation of events and life in general.
Accept that this person has a choice to think the way she does.
Tell the pessimist to make the choice that she feels most comfortable with.
Avoid giving advice or pushing the person to see or do things your way.
Resist the innate desire to attempt to cheer the pessimist up.
What you want to avoid is positively reinforcing her negative thoughts by providing a reward for pessimistic thinking (attention, positivity, etc).
Do n't seek to persuade the pessimist that everything will work out fine.
Remember that you can not control how she will interpret the situation.
Do n't be too quick to dismiss people due to their pessimism.
Learning to get along with people who are not like us is an important part of self - development and socialization.
Being pessimistic is n't always bad.
Some philosophers and researchers have argued it may actually make people happier and closer to reality because they will be more prepared and less disappointed if they consider that the worst outcome might occur.
Thus, when bad things do happen, they may be better at dealing with them.
Do n't just dive directly onto your partner's neck and go in for the hickey.
Spend some time kissing and French kissing first, then move your lips to your partner's throat.
Start with light kisses, then move into harder and more insistent kisses around the throat and collarbone.
However, the skin in the crook of your elbow or on the inner thigh are also pleasurable locations.
The side or the back of the neck is a good bet if your partner has long hair, or you could go to the collarbones, closer to the shoulder, so the skin can be covered by a regular crew - neck T - shirt.
Imagine you are making the letter "O" with your lips, then press them firmly onto your partner's skin so that you can make a good seal, without leaving any gaps for the air to escape.
The key here is to suck hard enough to break the capillaries just beneath the skin, but not so hard that you cause your partner too much pain.
You will need to suck for 20 to 30 seconds in order to make a mark.
Remember: Keep your teeth out of the way.
You do n't want them digging painfully into your partner's skin.
Break up the sucking.
If 30 solid seconds of hickey - making strikes you as too weird, try 10 seconds, some kissing, then another 10 seconds in the same spot, and so on.
When you're done sucking, try laying a few gentle kisses on the area, which probably feels more sensitive now.
If you want the hickey to be larger or darker, upon your partner's request , Return to the same spot and repeat the process again
Or your partner decides they ca n't risk their parents or employer seeing the mark.
Always respect your partner's wishes if they say "no," even if you've already started the process.
A hickey is sometimes seen as a mark of trust, so abusing that trust is not okay.

Using heat on tense muscles can relax the contracting muscle, but it will also help relieve the pain.
There are different kinds of options for heat therapy that include heating pads and rubs to hot water bottles, all of which may help alleviate your discomfort.
Fill a hot water bottle or get a heating pad and place it on your back.
Over the counter heat rubs or patches may also minimize tension and help relax muscle that are spasming.
You can purchase these products at most pharmacies.
Draw yourself a warm bath when you have back pain.
Warm water will soothe cramping and tense muscles.
It may also relieve general tension and relax you.
Make sure that the water is between 36 and 40 degrees Celcius so that your skin does n't burn.
Check the temperatures with a thermometer.
A whirlpool tub can help relieve tension because the jets will massage your back muscles.
Epsom salts can have a sedative effect on you and help relieve muscle pain further.
If you do n't have a bath, consider using the shower or a steam room.
Studies have not linked dehydration and tension, though there is some evidence that not staying hydrated may contribute to cramping.
Drinking enough throughout the day may help you avoid back spasms and tension.
Water is enough to keep you hydrated.
If you prefer something with a little flavor, try sports drinks or juices.
Just make sure to drink them with water throughout the day.
There is some evidence that tea, especially red raspberry leaf tea, can help relieve cramps.
Some medical studies have linked low levels of potassium, calcium and magnesium to muscle cramps.
Getting enough of these nutrients in your diet may help prevent back cramping and back.
Fruits such as bananas and oranges are good sources of potassium.
You can get magnesium from brown rice, almonds, and avocados.
Dairy products such as yogurt and cheese, and dark green vegetables such as spinach are good sources of calcium.
Reduce the amount of caffeine you consume and stay away alcohol and tobacco if you can.
All three can constrict blood vessels and limiting your intake during your period can alleviate cramping and back pain.
Reduce your intake of coffee and caffeinated tea as much as possible.
You should also reduce your consumption of foods that contain caffeine, such as chocolate , If you can, do n't drink alcoholic beverages during your period
They can constrict blood vessels, dehydrate you, and generally make you feel worse.
Avoid tobacco if you can.
If not, try chewing nicotine gum or use an electronic cigarette to minimize how much tobacco you ingest.
Sleeping in some positions and having a tightly made bed can increase the frequency of muscle cramps and exacerbate back pain.
Loosen your blankets and sheets and sleep on your side to minimize back pain and any cramping you have.
Consider sleeping without a flat sheet, which can constrict your movement.
The best position to help minimize the risk of developing cramps or back pain is on your side with your knees slightly bent.
If you're having a hard time visualizing an algebra problem, try using diagrams or pictures to illustrate your equation.
For example, let's solve the equation x + 2 = 3 by using boxes (☐) x +2 = 3 ☒ + ☐ ☐ = ☐ ☐ ☐ At this point, we'll subtract 2 from both sides by simply removing 2 boxes (☐ ☐) from both sides: ☒ + ☐ ☐ - ☐ ☐ = ☐ ☐ ☐ - ☐ ☐ ☒ = ☐, or x = 1 As another example, let's try 2x = 4 ☒ ☒ = ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ At this point, we'll divide both sides by two by separate the boxes on each side into two groups: ☒ | ☒ = ☐ ☐ | ☐ ☐ ☒ = ☐ ☐, or x = 2 When converting a word problem into algebra, try to check your formula by plugging in simple values for your variable.
Does your equation make sense when x = 0?
When x = 1?
When x = -1?
It's easy to make simple mistakes by writing down p = 6d when you mean p =d / 6, but these are easily caught if you do a quick sanity check on your work before going further.
We use the equation l = w + 30 to represent this.
We can test whether this equation makes sense by plugging in simple values for w. For instance, if the field is w = 10 yards (9.1 m) wide, it will be 10 + 30 = 40 yards (36.6 m) long.
If it's 30 yards (27.4 m) wide, it will be 30 + 30 = 60 yards (54.9 m) long, and so on.
This makes sense - we'd expect the field to get longer as it gets wider, so this equation is reasonable.
Answers in algebra and other advanced forms of math are n't always round, easy numbers.
They can often be decimals, fractions, or irrational numbers.
A calculator can help you find these complicated answers, but keep in mind that your teacher may require you to give your answer in its exact form, not in an unwieldy decimal.
For instance, let's say that we narrow down an algebra equation to x = 12507.
If we type 12507 into a calculator, we'll get a huge string of decimals (plus, since the calculator's screen is only so large, it ca n't display the entire answer.)
In this case, we may want to represent our answer as simply 12507 or else simplify the answer by writing it in scientific notation.
Factoring is a semi-advanced algebra topic, so consider consulting the article linked above if you're having trouble mastering it.
Below are just a few quick tips for factoring equations: Equations with the form ax + ba factor to a (x + b).
Example: 2x + 4 = 2 (x + 2) Equations with the form ax2 + bx factor to cx ((a / c) x + (b / c)) where c is the biggest number that divides into a and b evenly.
Example: 3y2 + 12y = 3y (y + 4) Equations with the form x2 + bx + c factor to (x + y) (x + z) where y × z = c and yx + zx = bx.
Example: x2 + 4x + 3 = (x + 3) (x + 1).
Progress in algebra (and any other kind of math) requires lots of hard work and repetition.
Do n't worry - by paying attention in class, doing all of your assignments, and seeking out help from your teacher or other students when you need it, algebra will begin to become second nature.
If you're having a hard time getting the hang of algebra, do n't worry - you do n't have to learn it on your own.
Your teacher is the first person you should turn to with questions.
After class, politely ask your teacher for help.
Good teachers will usually be willing to re-explain the day's topic at an after - school appointment and may even be able to give you extra practice materials.
If, for some reason, your teacher ca n't help you, try asking them about tutoring options at your school.
Many schools will have some sort of after - school program that can help you get the extra time and attention you need to start excelling at your algebra.
Remember, using free help that's available to you is n't something to be embarrassed about - it's a sign that you're smart enough to solve your problem!
A hickey, also known as a "love bite" or "kiss mark" is essentially a bruise caused by sucking or aggressively kissing another person's skin.
It is initially red in color, due to broken blood vessels beneath the skin.
It will later turn purple or dark brown as it heals.
Hickeys are a mark of passion.
Some people may wish to avoid the embarrassment of being caught with a hickey, so it is important to check in with whoever is receiving the hickey to see what they are comfortable with.
In addition, receiving a hickey can be somewhat painful, which is a mood killer for some people.
Ideally, you should measure over your bare skin, but you can wear a thin shirt if necessary.
To maintain consistency, wear the same clothing every time you measure.
Wrap a flexible measuring tape around your waist, just above the crest of your hip bones.
The measuring tape should feel snug and flat against your skin, but not so tight that it is uncomfortable.
You may need a mirror to make sure the measuring tape is level and lies flat against your skin.
Measure in the same location every time, and try to use the same measuring tape.
Waist circumference measurement does n't tell you your exact percentage of body fat, but it does gives you useful relative measurements.
Non-pregnant women whose waist circumference is > 35 inches (89 cm), and men whose waist circumference is > 40 inches (102 cm), are at increased risk of developing obesity - related conditions such as hypertension and adult - onset diabetes.
If you are not expecting to be pregnant nor gaining weight, and your waist circumference is growing, contact your doctor.
You may be pregnant or experiencing a medical issue.

Get rid of any unnecessary weight in your car or truck, such as golf clubs or unnecessary tools and materials.
Lowering the tailgate on a pickup truck actually reduces your gas mileage by reducing drag, too.
If the tailgate is n't lowered, an air cushion is created behind the cab that creates a low drag surface for the air to travel over.
But if you have to carry something, carry it in your trunk, not on the rack on top of your car.
With something on top of your car, there is way more drag, slowing your car down, making it more difficult to accelerate.
It should only take a few minutes – in fact, you may be able to do it yourself.
In the scheme of car parts to replace, air filters are pretty cheap.
Properly inflated tires will increase your traveling distance on a tank of gas.
Check your tire pressure more often when the outside temperature changes greatly.
Hot tires will have high pressure from expanding air – but if air is let out to the proper amount of pressure, then when cooled they will become too low in the cooler conditions, so you'll need to reinflate them when cooler.
Under inflated and greatly over-sized tires have more rolling resistance and this will reduce your miles per gallon (MPG) and cause tire wear from the excessive friction.
If you do need new tires, get radial ones.
They have a low rolling resistance, keeping your car aerodynamic.
It's a good idea for your fuel economy to change spark plugs and wires on schedule, and the coil (s) when their effectiveness is breaking down (such as shorting internally).
The better your engine runs, the more power it will produce using less fuel.
As a bonus, fewer oil changes are needed saving your time and reducing trips to the mechanic as well as less used oil for the environment.
When you're getting your tune up, ask your mechanic about what oil you should be using for your car and for saving gas.
He may be able to throw in a bottle or two with your tune - up.
Before changing your tires to the modern style thick ones, think again.
The more the width, the higher the rolling resistance offered and higher the fuel consumption.
Make eye contact.
Get her attention with a fun gesture.
You can post the most fantastic photos in the world, but no one will like them in the middle of the night.
Most activity with your photo will happen in the first few hours, so make those hours count.
Here's when you should post your photos: Post in the middle of the day, when people are likely to be bored at work and surfing the web.
Do n't post too early in the morning, or at five or six o'clock, because most people are too busy commuting to notice your photos.
Post your photos a little after dinner time.
People browse the web when they're tired in the evening.
Post your photos during special occasions.
Halloween, Christmas, and Valentine's Day are good times to post.
Although some are too busy celebrating to notice your photos, they may actually be more likely to check them out.
People may see them, but they may not want to admit that they have nothing better to do on a weekend than to look at instagram photos.
Like a few photos to get your friends' attention.
Pick a shade of pink if you have cool undertones.
Choose orange - based colors if you have warm undertones.

Unless you are withdrawing the daily interest you are accumulating, it will be added to the original amount of your principal which is a great way to save.
To calculate, you will need the principal amount, the annual interest rate, the number of compounding periods per year (365 for daily) and the number of years the money will be in your account.
Assign labels in column A, rows 1 - 5, for the Principal, Interest Rate, Period, Number of Years and Compound Interest Balance.
You can expand the cell by clicking on the right line of the column number, A, B, C, etc. (Arrows will then show that you can manipulate.)
These labels are for your reference only.
Period is 365 and the number of years is whatever you choose to calculate.
Leave cell B5 (Compound Interest Balance) blank for now.
For example, principal = $2,000, interest rate = 8% or .08, compounding periods = 365 and the number of years is 5.
= B1 * (1 + B2 / B3) ^ (B4 * B3) and click enter.
Compounded daily, the total principal and interest earned balance is $2983.52 after 5 years.
You can see it is a good idea to reinvest your interest earned.
The formula to use is Initial investment * (1 + Annual interest rate / Compounding periods per year) ^ (Years * Compounding periods per year).
The ^ indicates an exponent.
For example, using the same information from Step 3, principal = $2,000, interest rate = 8% or .08, compounding periods = 365 and the number of years is 5.

Many people in the international community see international and municipal law as two separate entities.
These people would say each system regulates separate subject matters and each exists in its own sphere.
They would say international law regulates the conduct of states and their interactions with one another.
On the other hand, they would say municipal law regulates the conduct of people within a sovereign state.
If you are a dualist, you would likely say the two barely interact at all.
However, if they do, it would usually be when municipal law is recognizing and incorporating the rules of international law.
Therefore, the national law would have supremacy over the international law.
In case of conflict between international and municipal law, a national court would apply municipal law.
Monists believe international law and municipal law are all part of one legal system.
To them, both laws are based on the same premise, which is regulating the conduct of people and things.
If you are a monist, international law will trump municipal law, even in national courts.
While nations are under a general obligation to follow international law, there is usually a great amount of leeway in how they choose to do so.
Nations are generally free to decide how they incorporate international law into municipal law.
While different nations handle this issue in different manners, the prevailing position seems to be dualist.
Therefore, most nations require the formal integration of international law through the passage of some municipal law.
In the international sphere, international law wins out over municipal law.
However, municipal law is useful evidence of international customary law and general principles of law.
In addition, international law often leaves questions to be answered by a nation's own laws.
Therefore, if you found yourself in international court, you might use municipal law to help you decide whether there has been a breach of international law.
An international court may even look to municipal law to help them interpret international law.
In the municipal (i.e., national) sphere, the interaction is more difficult to assess.
In general, less formal international agreements and customs are accepted and followed so long as there is no conflict with municipal law.
If there is a conflict, municipal law will usually win.
However, more formal treaties, so long as they are self - executing (i.e., operate within a nation automatically), are usually seen as being on par with municipal law.
However, some nations take different views.

If you have a Windows 10 computer that uses a Microsoft account (e.g., an email address) to log in, you can reset your password from online.
You'll need to do this from a different computer.
This is where Microsoft keeps updated links to their password reset resources.
Remember, the letters in the box are case - sensitive.
Depending on the recovery options you set up for your account, you may have only one of these options.
If you chose the "Text" option, you'll type in the last four digits of your recovery phone number; otherwise, you'll type in the full email address that's partially starred out.
Depending on the recovery option you selected, do one of the following: Text - Open your phone's Messages app, open the text from Microsoft, review the code in the text message, and type the code into the text box on your computer.
Email - Open your recovery email address' inbox, open the email from Microsoft, review the code in the email, and type the code into the text box on your computer.
Type whatever you want your new password to be into both text boxes on the page.
Your password must have at least 8 characters.
As long as your passwords match each other, you should now be able to log into your Windows 10 account by entering the password you just set.
There are no international statutes.
The United Nations agrees on conventions that member nations may choose to ratify and abide by, but there is no international governmental body.
International law is created by treaty, by custom, and by agreements between nations.
This is in stark contrast to the legislative process that creates the internal municipal laws of nations and states.
International treaties are legally binding agreements between nations.
In a nation like the United States, a treaty is an agreement ratified by Congress.
Once it has been ratified, it holds the same status as federal legislation (i.e., statutes).
Therefore, treaties can mean different things depending on the nation or international body discussing them.
An example of a treaty is the Treaty of Versailles, which was the peace settlement signed after World War I. International agreements are usually less formal than treaties, although the international community often sees them on the same level as treaties.
In the United States, an international agreement does not need to be ratified by Congress and they are only applicable in domestic law (i.e., they are not enforceable themselves).
An example of an international agreement is the Kyoto Protocol, which sets international emissions reductions with the hope of curbing climate change.
International customs are created when a nation generally and consistently adheres to a certain practice due to a sense of legal obligation.
They are not necessarily written down and are the least formal of all the sources of international law.
There is no police agency with complete international jurisdiction.
Even INTERPOL, the organization with 190 member countries, acts only as a coordination agency, passing information and training to municipal police forces.
When there is a dispute between nations, the international law is enforced through treaties, United Nations conventions, and the ICJ.
In municipal law legal disputes, the case will be decided based either on the civil laws, in the form of statutes, or by the body of common law in the forum state.
If the two sides in the legal dispute are sovereign nations, you can assume that international laws, enforcement methods, and dispute resolution will apply.
Conversely, if both parties are citizens of the same nation, municipal law enforcement, court systems, and jurisdictional rules will be used to settle the dispute.
When the citizenship is mixed, such as individuals of different countries or an individual in a dispute with a government of another sovereignty, the courts will look to any treaties, UN conventions, or contracts that may shed light on the jurisdiction before agreeing to accept jurisdiction.
This includes the amount of money you will be investing or saving, the length of the term and the proposed interest rates.
You may have several sets of variables if your intention is to compare alternatives.
You will need to prepare a calculation for each alternative in order to complete your comparison.
You will be entering the data from Step 1 into specific cells on the spreadsheet and then setting up formulas.
Once the formulas are calculated you can easily evaluate many different alternatives.
Popular spreadsheet programs include Microsoft Excel and iWork Numbers.
You can also find free spreadsheet applications online such as Google Docs or Zoho Sheet.
You can expand the cell by clicking on the right line of the column number, A, B, or C, etc. (Arrows will then show that you can manipulate.), These labels are for your reference only
Convert the percent interest to a decimal by dividing it by 100.
Leave cell B4 (Daily Interest) blank for now.
The interest rate is usually shown as an annual figure; it will need to be divided by 365 in order to reach the daily interest rate.
For example, if your principal to invest is $10,000, and your savings account is offering .5 percent interest, you will enter "10000" in cell B1 and "= .005 / 365" in cell B2.
The number of periods determines how long your investment will remain in the account untouched, except for the compounding interest that is added.
You can use a sample term of one year, which will be entered in cell B3 as "365."
Functions are special formulas offered by the spreadsheet designers to make your calculations easier.
Do this by clicking first on cell B4 to select it and then by clicking inside the formula bar.
Press the Enter key.

Depending on your hair type, you may need to wash it every day.
If you hair seems oily and flat by the end of each day, you should wash it daily.
Your hairstyle does n't need to be elaborate.
Your signature style could be as simple as parting it to the side and wearing a barrette!
You can also try braids, ponytails, and simple buns.
If you are n't sure how to do your hair, ask a friend for advice or visit a salon.
Smelling nice is an essential part of being a girly - girl!
Be sure you use deodorant every single day.
You can also wear perfume - many feminine women have a signature scent they wear every day.
If you do n't wear much perfume, try a light floral or fruit scent first.
Do n't use deodorant or perfume as a substitute for bathing.
Use as little perfume as possible, and only use it on pulse points like your wrists and neck.
Your perfume should be a subtle fragrance that people only notice when they're next to you, not a strong smell that hangs in the air around you.
Girly girls keep their teeth as clean as possible.
Brush and floss every day, and be sure to use mouthwash or mints to keep your breath smelling fresh.
Carry floss with you, and use it after every meal or snack.
It's okay if your teeth are crooked or if you wear braces , Just make sure they're clean
Try wearing a little bit of makeup to get a girly girl look.
Light makeup will make you look more feminine, and it's much easier to learn to apply than a full face of makeup.
Keep practicing until your makeup looks natural and is easy for you to apply.
Try using just lip gloss and mascara to start.
Keep eyeshadows and blushes in light, neutral colors like light pink or beige.
If you want to wear foundation, go to a makeup counter first to be sure it matches your skin tone.
Wearing heavier makeup is okay too , Just make sure you've practiced your look first
The acidic, anti-bacterial and antiseptic properties in some vegetables and fruits allow them to lighten the skin naturally.
Potatoes, cucumbers and lemons are three that can help eliminate dark skin under the arms.
Potato - Thinly slice a potato and rub a slice on the dark area.
Or, you can grate some of the potato to release the "juice."
Apply this juice to your underarms, let it dry 10 minutes and rinse.
Cucumber - Just as you did with the potato, you can rub cucumber slices on the affected area or grate some of the cucumber and use the juice.
You can go a step further and add a few drops of lemon juice and some turmeric (enough to make a paste) to the cucumber juice.
Apply the paste, wait a half hour and wash off.
Lemon - Rub a thick slice of lemon on the dark area; the fruit will remove dead skin cells and lighten the skin.
Follow - up by washing and, if necessary, applying moisturizer.
(With continued use, lemons can dry out the skin).
Add a small amount of tumeric, plain yogurt or honey to lemon juice to make a paste that can be left on for 10 minutes and then rinsed clean.
Egg oil - Gently massage egg oil on the dark area and leave on overnight; the omega - 3 in egg oil promote re-epithelisation (new skin cells) which make the skin smooth and light.
Wash in the morning with a pH balanced soap or body wash.
The single most important thing you can do to prevent or treat dark underarms is to moisturize the area at least twice a day.
Prefer to use natural moisturisers like aloe vera, lecithin etc..
Dark underarms may be caused by dead skin cells that have accumulated there, so exfoliating can reduce the dark appearance of the skin.
Sugar - Mix a cup of brown sugar with 3 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil.
Apply to wet skin for a minute or two during a shower or bath and rinse.
Try using the mixture twice a week when you bathe.
Baking soda - Make a thick baking soda - and - water paste to use as a scrub.
After scrubbing, rinsing and drying the area, you can apply a dusting of baking powder to the skin to give it a lighter appearance.
Baking soda and rosewater - Make a somewhat thick paste of baking soda and rose water.
Apply to the underarm area, then wash off with warm water.
Dry your arms.
Do this until you see lightening of armpits.
Orange - Peel an orange and put the peels out in the sun to dry.
Grind the peels to form a powder and make a paste by adding rose water and milk.
Scrub your underarms with the paste for 10 to 15 minutes to remove dead skin cells and rinse with cold water.
This light - weight, abrasive volcanic rock is sold in drug stores and beauty supply stores.
Wet the stone thoroughly and gently scrub the underarm area.
Open your refrigerator or kitchen cupboard to find remedies that can not only lighten dark underarms but make the skin softer and fresher Milk - It's the vitamins and fatty acids in milk that make it effective in lightening dark skin.
Create a paste of two tbsp. milk, one tsp. curd and one tbsp. flour.
Apply to the skin, let sit for 15 minutes and rinse with cold water.
Skin should be softer and free of dead skin cells, which will make the area look much lighter.
You can get even better results with full fat milk cream.
Vinegar - For a lighter look and germ - free, sweet - smelling skin, mix vinegar with rice flour to form a paste.
Take a hot shower and then apply the paste to the underarms, let dry for 10 - 15 minutes and rinse with warm water.
Coconut oil - The Vitamin E in coconut oil can help lighten dark skin over time, so for best results it should be used daily or every other day.
Before bathing, massage the oil into the skin for 10 to 15 minutes.
Rinse with a mild soap and lukewarm water.
Another benefit of coconut oil -- it's a natural deodorant.
If you're willing to commit to a frequent treatment regimen, you can try a natural whitening pack made from gram flour (also known a chickpea flour).
Mix the flour with yogurt, lemon and a little turmeric to form a thick paste.
Apply and leave in place for at least 30 minutes before rinsing with warm water.
Apply this whitening paste daily for two weeks and then three times a week to speed up the whitening effect.
Dark underarms may be caused by thick hair under the skin due to shaving.
Because waxing removes hair at the root, it may leave the area lighter and the skin softer.
The strong antiperspirant chemicals of deodorants often darken underarms by an inflammatory response.
Very few people actually have a problem with body odor and most do not need the widely advertised deodorants.
Brush daily Floss Use an antibacterial mouth rinse.
Visit the dentist regularly.
In order to remove the battery from a Samsung Galaxy Tab, you will need a plastic pry tool and a tiny screwdriver.
Some models require a tri-wing screwdriver.
You can purchase all the tools you need, along with a replacement battery or you can just purchase a replacement battery kit that comes with all the tools.
The wrong kit may not have the right battery or tools.
If you do not have a plastic pry tool, you can use any thin piece of plastic, such as a guitar pick, or a thin piece of plastic cut from a soda bottle.
Press and hold the power button on the side or your Samsung Galaxy Tab unit to power off your device.
Some Galaxy Tab 10 models have screws on both sides of the charging port.
If your Galaxy Tab model has screws to the sides of the charging port, use a safety pin or sharp object to remove the screw covers and then use a tri-wing screwdriver to remove the screws.
Insert the plastic pry tool in between where the back cover attaches to the front , This is usually along the side edges of the device
On some models, it may be on the front around the screen.
Go around the entire device while gently applying pressure to separate the front cover from the back.
Keep in mind that the clips that attach the back cover are easy to break, so go slowly and carefully.
Be careful not to tear the microphone cable when you separate the front panel from the top left corner of the Galaxy Tab.
Once all the clips are popped out, remove the back cover and set it aside.
There may be tape covering the ribbon cable connectors and battery.
Use the plastic pry tool to remove the tape and set it aside.
Many larger Samsung Galaxy Tab 10 models have 2 or 3 ribbon cables that go over the top of the battery.
Use the plastic pry tool to pop the tab on the front of the connectors where the ribbon cables are attached.
Then slide the ribbon cables out of the connectors.
If no tab is present on the connectors, simply slide the ribbon cables out.
On some Galaxy Tab models, the battery may be screwed in place.
Use a tiny Philips screwdriver to remove the screws on all sides of the battery.
There are 4 wires from the battery that attached to a black clip connected to the mainboard.
Place the plastic pry tool under the wires and apply upward pressure to disconnect the wire clip from the board.
Once the battery is disconnected, simply lift the battery out to remove it.
For women with regular menstrual cycles, or who are already on the pill, they should know pretty much exactly when their next period is coming.
You can then determine if your menstrual cycle will occur on the days you do n't want it to.
If a conflict exists, do n't worry as you can avoid having your period on that day, as long as you plan for it in advance!
Note that for women with irregular menstrual cycles, it is not always possible to know in advance when your next period will occur.
Most birth control pills come in packs of 21 active pills (containing hormones), followed by seven inactive pills (placebo or "sugar pills").
The pills are packaged this way to help keep you in your "routine" of taking one pill a day, while allowing a withdrawal bleed (a period) during the days of inactive pills.
You are then instructed to repeat the cycle every month: 21 days of active pills, followed by seven days of inactive pills.
However, if you have an important sporting event coming up, or a reason you want to delay your period, you can use your birth control pills to do so.
Here's how: It is not required that you follow the exact routine of 21 active pills followed by seven inactive pills.
The ratio of 21 to seven is quite arbitrary.
It was meant to mimic a woman's natural menstrual cycle of approximately 28 days, but it is by no means essential to follow this ratio all of the time.
This works most of the time for most women.
However, do not count on it being 100% effective as some women's bodies do n't respond to such a "sudden" change in their birth control regimen.
If it is a "last - minute realization" that you want to delay your period, your best bet is to keep taking the "active pills" all the way from day 21 through to when the event is over.
Then stop the active pills and take the seven inactive pills to allow a withdrawal bleed.
If you do this, most doctors advise to throw out the partially used pack of birth control pills (the pack you took the "extra" pills from to get you through to the important event).
The way the pills are packaged (normally with 21 active pills and seven inactive ones) is key for most women to keep track of how many pills they have taken and when they are supposed to take each kind.
A more "certain" way to delay your period would be to begin adjusting your birth control regimen earlier - as in, a few months before the event for which you are trying to avoid having a period.
If you make the switch earlier (by taking more active pills in an earlier month and then continuing the once a month routine), you body will have plenty of time to adjust to the change.
To do this, you will need to look at your calendar well in advance.
If, for instance, you notice that in four months you need to delay your period by 10 days, extend the length of time you are taking your active pills by 10 days during your current cycle, instead of just during the month you need to skip your period.
Then take the seven inactive pills.
By making the change a few months in advance (for instance, competitive athletes may do this if an important event like provincials or nationals is coming up) you give your body the very best chance of adjusting and of not having any period concerns on your big day.
If you're interested in skipping or delaying your period for longer periods rather than just a week or month, some birth control pills are designed to lengthen times between periods.
Most of them give you a period once every three months rather than once a month.
These methods are called continuous dosing or extended cycle.
Extended cycle birth control pills are meant to be taken continuously for a period of weeks.
Most brands are taken for 12 weeks at a time.
Because this does alter your hormone balance (having a period once every three months rather than once a month), it is important to speak to your doctor to confirm that this is a healthy choice for you.
Generally speaking, there should be no problem if you have been approved to take the birth control pill in the first place.
If you're not comfortable taking birth control pills or are unable to do so, your doctor can prescribe a hormone tablet called norethisterone.
You take norethisterone pills three times a day in the days leading up to your period.
Norenthisterone is a progesterone hormone.
Progesterone levels drop in the time leading up to your period, causing the lining of the uterus to shed and your period to begin.
Keeping the levels high before your period can delay or stop menstruation.
Side effects may include bloating, upset stomach, breast discomfort, and reduced sex drive.
Your doctor will insert the IUD - a small, plastic t - shaped device - into your uterus.
The IUD will release progestin and may lead to your period being lighter or may stop it completely.
IUDs last five to seven years.

Scheduling your time is n't just important for being productive and meeting your social demands.
It can also be quite helpful in keeping yourself healthy and happy.
Researchers have found, for example, that college students who make sure to schedule time for self - care can handle stress better and meet their goals more successfully.
Self - care is different for every person.
It can include meditating, taking a nap, playing video games, calling a friend, or other activities.
Figure out which activities work best for you in producing pleasure and / or reducing stress.
Fixed time is a set amount of time that you dedicate to self - care.
While you may understand that you need self - care, you may not actually do so unless you have set times that are specifically intended for self - care.
Schedule a monthly massage, or plan for 30 minutes of video gaming every day.
Making time for yourself will make it easier for you to tackle some of the more unpleasant obligations.
As you successfully maneuver your day based upon the schedule that you've constructed, be sure to reward yourself for your hard work.
Maybe keep your favorite candy in your pocket and allow yourself to indulge when you successfully complete a scheduled activity.
This sort of positive reinforcement can help you associate functional changes in your behavior with pleasurable feelings.
Most people's natural immune systems are strong enough to effectively deal with minor skin infections such as boils.
Thus, boils often heal on their own after a period of a few weeks, although you'll likely experience some itching and mild throbbing pain in the early stages.
Boils can become more painful with time as the pressure builds up from pus accumulation, although they can spontaneously burst after a few weeks and then clear up quickly.
If you are anticipating a boil bursting on its own after a few weeks, be prepared by carrying some antibiotic wipes and clean tissues with you or in your car.
If you have a boil on your face, keep it clean and refrain from covering it up with a thick layer of make - up or cover - up.
Facial boils can be embarrassing, but it's best to expose them to the air and let your immune system deal with them.
Applying a warm washcloth or flannel compress to your boil helps to rupture and drain it because the heat expands the blood vessels underneath the skin and increases blood and lymph flow.
The warmth may also help sooth the pain, even though it's promoting local inflammation.
Soak a clean washcloth in water and put it in the microwave for between 30 - 45 seconds.
Apply the warm compress to the affected area several times daily (for about 20 minutes at a time) until the boil starts to naturally drain and shrink.
Be sure to wash and rinse the towel once you are done to avoid spreading the infection, although microwaving it will likely kill any bacteria anyway.
Make sure the cloth from the microwave does n't scald your skin and make the problem worse.
Tea tree oil is a natural antibiotic / antiseptic commonly used to treat skin infections - it's extracted from the leaves of the Australian tea tree.
Tea tree oil may help get rid of boils because it has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, although the degree to which it can absorb deep into the skin is not well understood.
It's also useful for preventing the spread of the bacteria once the boil has burst.
Use a clean swab, dip it into the tea tree oil and then lightly dab your boil three to five times daily.
Keep it away from your eyes as it might sting.
Tea tree oil can trigger allergic reactions in some people (it's rare), so stop applying it if you notice the skin around the boil is getting irritated and puffy.
Other natural antibiotics that have similar effects to tea tree oil include: olive leaf extract, oregano oil, lavender, hydrogen peroxide, white vinegar, and iodine solution , Once the boil bursts on its own, promote drainage by lightly putting some pressure on the edges with clean absorbent tissues
Do n't be surprised if you see quite a bit of pus and blood come out of a boil - it's typically much more compared to a large pimple.
Soak as much of the blood and pus up as possible, dispose of the tissue, then thoroughly clean the area with antibiotic wipes.
Boils are n't contagious, but the bacteria within them can be.
The boil may continue to "weep" (slowly drain) for a few hours, so consider dabbing it with some antibiotic cream or lotion and then covering it with a small bandage overnight.
Exposing the draining boil to some fresh air and sunlight will promote healing, but too much sun can burn the damaged tissue and leave a discolored spot for many weeks or months.
Keep applying warm compresses for a few days after the boil has opened to help drain it as much as possible.
Remember to always use clean compresses.

To ensure you do n't look washed out, select a hair color that contrasts, rather than matches, your skin tone.
Choose cool shades of blond like platinum or champagne if you have warm undertones.
Choose warm shades like honey or butterscotch if you have cool undertones.
Neutral undertones can work with any shade.
Brown hair can look great with any complexion, and it's a lot easier to get the right shade.
Warm undertones look best with ashy browns, especially with highlights added.
Try a chestnut brown.
Cool undertones look great with rich browns.
Look for chocolate, mocha browns.
If you have a deep skin tone, look for a shade of brown that is either darker or lighter than your skin color, rather than one that is too similar.
Warmer undertones will look great with deep blacks or espresso colors, while cooler tones will come alive with colors like toffee or maple brown.
Neutral undertones can rock any shade of brown.
If you pick the right shade of red, any complexion can wear it well.
However, light skin most easily glows with a red shade.
Those with pale skin and warm or neutral undertones can best wear light reds like strawberry blond.
Pale skin with red undertones can look great with cool, dark reds like true red or dark auburn.
Cool undertones also look great with dark auburn shades, no matter if your complexion is light, medium, or deep.
If you have olive undertones, it's best to avoid reds, as they can make your skin look greenish.

Dogs squint, making their eyes appear smaller, when they are in pain, stressed, or depressed.
Depressed dogs may also be reluctant to make eye contact with anybody, even you.
Of course, some dogs have "sad" eyes at the best of times, due to naturally droopy eyelids rather than depression, so exercise a little common sense when interpreting sad eyes as a sign of depression.
For example, your dog may fail to prick up their ears at the sound of things that normally interest them, such as you calling their name, or their collar and lead being fetched prior to a walk.
Licking or chewing their paws is a comfort mechanism for dogs, and can be a sign of depression.
Depressed dogs tend to keep their heads lowered when standing or sitting.
When lying down your dog prefers to rest their chin on the ground, and rarely raises their head in response to activity going on around them.
When a dog is depressed, the tail is held down or between the legs and does n't wag as readily.
When you encourage your dog to wag his tail, the motion is subdued and half - hearted.
Depressed dogs tend to stand in a passive way, with their heads down and tails lowered, barely reacting to encouragement.
Your dog may give the impression of feeling sluggish, and will lack interest in what's going on around them.
When dogs are stressed, they tend to shed much more heavily.
If you pet your dog and your hand comes away covered in hair, or if you are suddenly having to vacuum much more often, your dog may be depressed.
Use pictures to make problems clearer.
Use "common sense checks" (especially for word problems).

Give feedback and help your pessimistic friend understand her effect on others.
Be mature in your interactions with her.
Be respectfully honest.
If the pessimistic person is bothering you in some way or affecting you negatively, let her know.
Say you're sorry that she sees things that way but you see things differently.
I feel when you.
Focus on your own feelings rather than on the other person's actions.
Avoid labeling.
Telling a person who has pessimistic thinking that she is a pessimist will most likely be unhelpful and could lead to conflict.
One thing you can do is attempt to offer alternative ways of looking at the problem.
Remember though, you are not trying to save her from pessimism or cheer her up.
You are simply expressing your opinion and disagreeing with her view of the situation.
You may need to spend time apart from this person or distance yourself.
Setting boundaries on what you discuss with the person and how long you bathe in her influence can be useful ways of overcoming your dislike of being in her presence.
Do not just ignore her; that would be considered passive - aggressive communication.
Limit your interactions if necessary.
However, if she is your friend, coworker or family member you may not be able, nor wish, to avoid her, In this case, minimizing the amount of time spent around her can be beneficial to your own sense of well - being
Exercise compassion when dealing with others who think differently from you.
If the pessimist does n't want to do something that you do, be empathetic about her worries or plight.
This is a kind, yet subtle, way to highlight the thing she is being negative about - by focusing on it directly and expressing sympathy for her worry, and pain.
Be understanding and supportive without validating the negativity.
For example, tell a pessimist who is disinclined join you in an activity that she can go home / not come, while you go ahead and do it anyway , Say something like, 'I'm sorry this is hard on you
Go ahead and do whatever it is you need to feel better (go home / not come / stay here / do the easier task, etc.).

In algebra, you'll start to see letters and symbols appear in your math problems, rather than just numbers.
These are called variables.
Variables are n't as confusing as they may first seem - they're just ways of showing numbers with unknown values.
Below are just a few common examples of variables in algebra: Letters like x, y, z, a, b, and c Greek letters like theta, or θ Note that not all symbols are unknown variables.
For instance, pi, or π, is always equal to about 3.14159.
As mentioned above, variables are basically just numbers with unknown values.
In other words, there's some number that can go in place of the variable to make the equation work.
Usually, your goal in an algebra problem is to figure out what the variable is - think of it as a "mystery number" that you're trying to discover.
For example, in the equation 2x + 3 = 11, x is our variable.
This means that there's some value that goes in the place of x to make the left side of the equation equal 11.
Since 2 × 4 + 3 = 11, in this case, x = 4.
An easy way to start understanding variables is to replace them with question marks in algebra problems.
For example, we might re-write the equation 2 + 3 + x = 9 as 2 + 3 +?
This makes it easier to understand what we're trying to do - we just need to find out what number to add to 2 + 3 = 5 to get 9.
What do you do if the same variable appears more than once in the equation?
Though this situation may seem tricky to solve, you can actually treat variables how you'd treat normal numbers - in other words, you can add them, subtract them, and so on as long as you only combine variables that are alike.
In other words, x + x = 2x, but x + y does n't equal 2xy.
For example, let's look at the equation 2x + 1x = 9.
In this case, we can add 2x and 1x together to get 3x = 9.
Since 3 x 3 = 9, we know that x = 3.
Note again that you can only add the same variables together.
In the equation 2x + 1y = 9, we ca n't combine 2x and 1y because they are two different variables.
This is also true for when one variable has a different exponent than another.
For instance, in the equation 2x + 3x2 = 10, we ca n't combine 2x and 3x2 because the x variables have different exponents.
See How to Add Exponents for more information.
Get up once an hour and walk around for a minute or two just to keep your blood flowing.
Long periods of sitting can cause blood to pool in your feet, which causes more swelling.
If you have to sit for a long period of time, use a footstool to help promote circulation.
Wear full - length support stockings to increase blood flow and ease swelling in your feet.
Stockings are most effective if you wear them all day, particularly if you're going to be standing a lot.
Avoid compression socks, which may squeeze above the ankle and encourage foot swelling.
You can purchase support stockings online at health supply stores, such as ExMed and Walgreens.
Drinking enough water can flush your body of extra salt and reduce foot swelling.
For most people though, drinking at least 48 ounces (1.4 liters) of water a day will keep excess swelling to a minimum.
While the occasional soda or coffee is fine, do not count these beverages as part of your daily water intake.
They can have a diuretic effect.
Do n't force yourself to drink more if you ca n't.
Aim to work out for at least 30 minutes 4 to 5 days a week to keep your blood flowing.
Even a casual walk will keep your heart rate up and discourage blood from pooling in your feet.
If you're sedentary right now, slowly work your way up to 4 days a week by starting with a 15 minute session one day at a time.
If you have limitations due to pregnancy or injury, ask your doctor what exercises you can do to alleviate swelling.
Exercising with a buddy can be a great way to stick to a new fitness routine.
Certain yoga poses, such as lying on the floor with your legs up against the wall, can reduce foot swelling, too.
Wear shoes that fit you well and ensure that the ball of your foot fits in the widest part of the shoe easily.
When you wear shoes that are too small, it can cut off circulation, causing pain or even injury.
Focus on something else before sleep.
Leave your door open or closed - whichever makes you feel more comfortable.
Go slowly to avoid strain or injury.
Avoid picking someone up in an emergency if you lack professional training.
Make sure someone is okay with being picked up.
Be careful picking someone up in public.
75 °F (24 °C) is the ideal blooming temperature for hibiscus plants, although they can withstand warmer and cooler temperatures.
There should be no danger of frost after planting your hibiscuses.
If the temperature falls below 45 °F (7 °C), the plants may not recover , Hibiscuses can not survive frost or freezing temperatures
You can plant hibiscuses outside in spring, summer, or fall in temperate climates.
They are tropical plants, so they prefer humidity, warm temperatures, and 8 to 10 hours of direct sunlight each day.
The plants will still grow in partial shade, but they will be less healthy and bloom far less frequently in this environment.
Hibiscuses need well - draining soil to thrive, and poor - draining soil will cause root rot.
If it takes an hour or more to drain, the drainage is poor.
To improve drainage, mix in organic matter like well - rotted manure, compost, or peat moss.
If the soil drains well, you do n't need to add anything else to it.
Check the size of the plant's root ball, then dig a hole that's about the same depth.
Make the hole at least 2 or 3 times wider than the root ball.
Gently remove the plant from its container and place it in the hole.
Add soil around the plant until the hole is half - filled.
Water the hole well, let it drain, and then fill the rest of the hole with soil.
Water the plants thoroughly after putting them in the ground.
Plant hibiscuses 3 ft (91 cm) to 6 ft (180 cm) apart.
Hibiscus plants need plenty of water and like their soil to be consistently moist, but never soggy.
You can check the soil's moisture by touching it.
If it feels dry and crusty, your plants need to be watered.
If the soil feels soft and damp to the touch, you do n't need to water your plants that day.
Touch the water before pouring it on the plants.
They do n't like cold water, so use water that feels warm but never hot to the touch.
Hibiscuses need a minimum of 1 in (2.5 cm) of water every week.
These plants prefer rainwater, but will do fine with city water.
Use a water - soluble or liquid fertilizer for best results.
A balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer will work just fine.
Choose an organic variety that contains trace elements like potassium, iron, and magnesium.
Apply the fertilizer at the base of each plant every 2 weeks.
Do n't use chemical fertilizers on hibiscus plants.
If you can find a fertilizer with a very low amount of phosphorus in it, like a 10-4-12 or 9-3-13, go with that.
Avoid over-fertilizing since too much phosphorus can kill the plants.
These particular pests can be a problem for outdoor hibiscus plants.
Check your plants weekly for signs of infestation.
If you discover an infestation, apply a horticultural oil or insecticidal soap to the affected areas to get rid of the problem.
Avoid insecticides that contain the ingredient imidacloprid since this ingredient can worsen spider mite infestations.
Pruning will keep your plants looking healthy and stimulate blooms.
Prune once per season, in the fall, although pruning can be done successfully in the spring if necessary.
Keep 3 to 4 sturdy main branches on each plant , Cut away about a third of the remaining branches
Remove all weak growth and any branches that are growing sideways.
Use baking soda.
Eat apples and melons.
Rub orange peel on your teeth.
Chew sesame seeds.
Apply tomatoes and strawberries to your teeth.
Make a homemade toothpaste.
Have healthy regard for others' opinions.
Use your body language to convey confidence.
Be comfortable in the way you communicate.
Try new things regularly.
A written note shows her that you care enough to share your feelings with her.
Make sure it is handwritten; do n't type and print a note!
Here are some starters: "I've been thinking about you all day..." "I wish I could be there with you, but this note will have to do..." "I ca n't wait until I see you next..." Place the note where it will have the most impact.
Ideally, finding the note should be a surprise.
For example, if you know she has to read certain pages of a book for school, place it between those pages.
If you are sleeping together, write a note on the bathroom mirror with soap, or place a love note on her nightstand.
Call or text her when she's getting ready to go to sleep.
This is known as the "tuck in call," and it is a very powerful way to show her you care.
The tuck in call lets her know that she's on your mind.
You will be the last thing she thinks about before falling asleep.
It gives her someone to talk with about any of the problems she may have had that day, which will help her sleep better.
Chocolates range from the cheap to the quite expensive.
You do n't have to spend an arm and a leg, but avoid just giving her a bar from the candy aisle.
Look for boutique chocolates and remember that a little goes a long way.
Imported candies are a fancy way to show that you care about her, and can be exciting to try.
They're not terribly expensive either.
Bake her some cookies.
This shows thoughtfulness as well as adeptness in the kitchen.
If she does n't like sweets, surprise her with her favorite snack.
This is one of the most traditional ways to show affection, and is very effective.
They are bright and cheery, and the freshness is a vitalizing gift.
Flowers can get expensive, however, so save them for truly special occasions.
Most supermarkets have bouquets available for less than $20.
If you know your girlfriend's favorite colors or flowers, talk to a florist and have them help you design a bouquet.
If you have access to wildflowers, pick and make her one yourself.
Just be sure that you do n't cut someone's private flowers.
If your girlfriend is having a bad day at the office, have some flowers delivered.
This can be expensive, but it shows you care and she can show off to her coworkers.
A single flower can be just as good as a whole bouquet.
It's the gesture of giving that is the most important.
A surprise gift can spice up a normally dull day and really let her know that you're thinking of her.
Give her a set of coupons that she can redeem to get you to do things for her.
For example, romantic dinners, movie night, hugs and kisses on demand, etc. , An accessory
Clothes can be expensive, but a nice accessory can make a great gift and not break the bank.
Look for hats, scarves, or handbags.
A bottle of wine and a pair of wineglasses.
Catch her off guard and you'll make a much more lasting impact.
Sneak up on her while she's working and give her a quick kiss.
Give her an extra hug before she heads off to work or school.
Pull her in closer while walking together on a cold day.
Take her hand while walking out in public.
Books have a level of detail that makes it easy to fall into their stories and tune out the world around you in addition to your own thoughts and emotions - including fear generated by something scary - and the distraction from scary thoughts is not the only benefit reading before bed offers; there are several good reasons to read before bed in general.
Be sure the book you choose is not scary or you will defeat the book's purpose of occupying your mind.
Choose a book that is happy, funny, or complicated enough that you will occupy your mind effectively.
Consider a book that deals with a topic you find somewhat uninspiring - such as a school textbook or the like, as this alone might put you to sleep.
Humor is a great way to occupy your mind when you are too scared to sleep.
In fact, good humor, including laughter, is good for your health too.
The media you expose yourself to before sleep can affect your dreams, so watching something less scary before sleeping can keep you from having trouble sleeping in the first place.
Even better, choose something you are familiar with already - something you have already seen, like a favorite film - to watch after something scary.
This will not only interrupt the possibility of the scary media affecting your dreams and your ability to sleep, but it might be comforting to some extent as well because it is familiar.
A great way to occupy your mind when you are having trouble sleeping is by crafting.
The repetition that many crafts require might act as just the mind occupier you need.
Times of extreme stress can cause your period to get delayed.
Stress alters the function of your hypothalamus, the part of your brain that regulates your hormones and causes menstruation to happen.
If you think stress could be the reason your period is late, take measures to decrease sources of anxiety in your life.
Spend the time relaxing, eating well and exercising.
Cancel social obligations that may be stressing you out.
Give yourself some "me" time.
Try meditating or practicing yoga.
If your stress is chronic, talk to someone who can help.
Consider making an appointment with a therapist who can help you find a good solution.
There's no scientific explanation for why taking a hot bath helps bring on a period, but many people find it works.
Perhaps it's helpful because the warm water relaxes your body, easing physical and emotional stress at the same time.
Give yourself time for a good, long soak in the bath when you want your period to start.
Try adding relaxing essential oils to the tub.
Lavender, lemongrass and rose essential oils will help you destress as you bathe.
Focus on letting your body completely relax and let go.
Massage your legs, arms, face and scalp to improve your circulation.
If you are 10 percent or lower below the normal body weight for your height, this can cause a disruption in your menstrual cycle.
Many people find that allowing themselves to gain a little weight causes their cycles to become more regular.
Find out what's considered a healthy body weight for you by talking with your doctor.
You could also use a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator, but know that experts disagree on whether this calculation is an accurate measure of a person's health.
If you have an eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia, seek treatment right away.
These disorders are very difficult to correct on your own.
In addition to disrupting your menstrual cycle, they can cause other long - term health problems.
Overtraining can lead to decreased levels of estrogen in your body, causing your period to stop.
Low estrogen levels can have negative side effects, including causing your bones to become brittle.
If you think overtraining might be the problem, you'll need to change your routine right away.
Talk with your doctor about your training schedule to determine whether this might be the case.
Long - distance runners, weight lifters and other athletes who train heavily on a daily basis are most at risk.
Although there may be pressure to keep training as hard as you are, it's important for your health that you scale back if you're overdoing it.
Taking the Pill or another hormonal contraceptive can give you total control over your cycle, and even eradicate it, for months at a time.
Hormonal contraceptives are often prescribed as treatment for irregular, long or very painful periods.
Talk with your doctor about whether taking a hormonal contraceptive is a good choice for your situation.
If you never acknowledge your followers' photos, then they wo n't acknowledge you.
Like 15 - 20 of their pictures.
If they notice you, they may like your pictures and follow you!
Solving an equation in algebra usually means finding out what the variable is.
Algebra equations are usually set up with numbers and / or variables on both sides, like this: x + 2 = 9 × 4.
To figure out what the variable is, you need to get it by itself on one side of the equals sign.
Whatever is left on the other side of the equals sign is your answer.
In the example (x + 2 = 9 × 4), to get x by itself on the left side of the equation, we need to get rid of the "+ 2".
To do this, we'll simply subtract 2 from that side, leaving us with x = 9 × 4.
However, to keep both sides of the equation equal, we also need to subtract 2 from the other side.
This leaves us with x = 9 × 4 - 2.
Following the order of operations, we multiply first, then subtract, giving us an answer of x = 36 - 2 = 34.
As we just saw above, getting x by itself on one side of the equals sign usually means getting rid of the numbers next to it.
To do this, we perform the "opposite" operation on both sides of the equation.
For instance, in the equation x + 3 = 0, since we see a "+ 3" next to our x, we'll put a "- 3" on both sides.
The "+ 3" and "- 3", leaving x by itself and "- 3" on the other side of the equals sign, like this: x = -3.
In general, addition and subtraction are like "opposites" - do one to get rid of the other.
See below: For addition, subtract.
Example: x + 9 = 3 → x = 3 - 9 For subtraction, add.
Example: x - 4 = 20 → x = 20 + 4 Multiplication and division are a little harder to work with than addition and subtraction, but they have the same "opposite" relationship.
If you see a "× 3" on one side, you'll cancel it by dividing both sides by 3, and so on.
With multiplication and division, you must perform the opposite operation on everything on the other side of the equals sign, even if it's more than one number.
See below: For multiplication, divide.
Example: 6x = 14 + 2 → x = (14 + 2) / 6 For division, multiply.
Example: x / 5 = 25 → x = 25 × 5 Exponents are a fairly advanced pre-algebra topic - if you do n't know how to do them, see our basic exponent article for more information.
The "opposite" of an exponent is the root that has the same number as it.
For example, the opposite of the 2 exponent is a square root (√), the opposite of the 3 exponent is the cube root (3 √), and so on.
It may be a little confusing, but, in these cases, you take the root of both sides when dealing with an exponent.
On the other hand, you take the exponent of both sides when you're dealing with a root.
See below: For exponents, take the root.
Example: x2 = 49 → x = √ 49 For roots, take the exponent.
Example: √ x = 12 → x = 122
Get to know her friends and family.
Plan a treasure hunt.
Cook her a meal.
Plan a picnic.
A fireman's carry is traditionally used to carry someone to safety in the event of an injury.
However, if you're not professionally trained, it's a bad idea to interfere with an injured person.
You can still use the fireman's carry for fun.
To start, have the girl stand directly in front of you so the two of you are standing face - to - face.
To start the fireman's carry, shift your weight to your right leg.
Put it between the girl's legs.
Then, have her drape her right arm over your right shoulder.
Place your head under the girl's armpit and wrap your arm around her right knee.
Now that you're in the position, squat down.
Have the girl lean her body over your right shoulder, shifting her weight onto the right side of your body.
Then, take her right hand with your right hand, pulling her torso around your neck.
From here, you can stand up.
The girl's torso will be draped around your neck, with her legs on the right side of your body.
You'll be holding her legs and right hand with your right arm.
Her head should be leaning on your left shoulder.
Once again, make sure to lift with your legs over your back.
Due to how weight is distributed, you should be able to carry a girl for a fairly long distance using the fireman's carry.
However, the positioning may feel awkward or uncomfortable for the girl.
She may ask to be put down if she feels uncomfortable being carried like this.
Apple App Store and Google Play Store are loaded with hundreds of apps you can use to like photos, earn "coins," and spend the coins to buy likes.
Find one of these on the App Store or Google Play Store by searching keywords such as "Get likes," "Get likes for Instagram," or "Instagram likes".
Look at reviews of the app , Decide which ones are most reliable
After selecting an app, download it.
Apps usually have a skip button, which can be used to skip photos you dislike.
Beware that the app may not deliver 100% of the likes you buy.
Gargle salt water.
Eat some honey.
Make honey, lemon, and ginger tea.
Drink milk with turmeric.
Drink apple cider vinegar.
Wear supportive shoes for exercise.
Avoid wearing high heels every day.
Massage your feet to ease pain and improve circulation when needed.
Take over-the-counter anti-inflammatories to manage minor pain.
Read a book.
Follow up a scary film with a comedy.
Try crafting.
Before you can figure out how to optimize your time, get a good sense for how you already manage day - to - day affairs.
If you have to attend school or work, these hours are already managed for you.
In your free time, you have a much greater degree of flexibility.
Spend a few days keeping track of how you spend your time.
Write down exactly what you do every day.
Pay close attention to how you spend free time.
Do you play video games, or do you clean the house?
Make a list of these activities and how long you spend on them.
It's likely that you spend a relatively large amount of some of your days simply traveling to or from work or school, or running errands.
This is time that's necessary to keep your days organized and complete essential tasks.
Notice how long these commutes typically take and allot enough time in your daily schedule to get from place to place.
Adjust your schedule based upon these times.
As you design your daily schedule, think about how you will structure your various tasks.
It might be a good idea to rearrange some of your tasks so that you can maximize your productivity.
For example, figure out when you can work most productively.
Determine when you will get distracted answering the phone or emails.
You may find that you work best in the early morning, while mid-afternoon is a time when you get bombarded with phone calls.
Keeping a daily schedule is very much about learning how routines affect your day - to - day life.
Sometimes routines can be bad habits, which might actually keep you from getting pleasure or reaching your goals.
Other routines are necessary for these things to occur.
As you experiment with scheduling your time, think about the role routines already play in your life.
For example, you might notice a trend in your daily life whereby you tire yourself out doing an activity you enjoy.
Then you do n't have the desire or energy to do anything else, such as working towards a longer term goal.
On the other hand, you could spend all of your time meeting one social demand after the next to where you never make time for self - care.
Each of these routines can be equally harmful to your personal well - being.
So it's important to take note of how routines affect your life.
As you start to notice the routine in your life that keep you from meeting your goals or getting what you desire, think of ways to alter them in order to get more out of your time.
This could be as simple as putting restrictions around certain activities, such as playing video games.
Perhaps you'll only permit yourself to play them after you complete a task relevant to a long - term goal.
Or maybe it is necessary to learn how to tell people no when they ask you to do something so that you can work on self - care.
There may be parts of your day that seem to waste time.
Many of these may be unavoidable, such as your morning commute or going to the post office at lunchtime when it's busiest.
Take a look at your schedule and figure out the moments in which time is wasted.
Think about how you might rearrange your schedule to reduce time wasters.
Get some quiet time during your morning commute by riding the bus.
Then you may be able to enjoy some coffee while reading a novel.
It's usually best to make plans for your day in advance.
If you have never made a schedule before, it might take some time to work out all of the kinks.
Do n't expect yourself to figure this out the first day, or even the first week.
Make a rough schedule for the next day where you list all of the activities you want to complete and the amount of time you want to spend on each.
Allow some flexibility as you get acclimated to having your time budgeted.
Most boils are caused by ingrown hairs or by splinters or debris getting lodged in the skin.
In otherwise healthy people with strong immune systems, the boils get resolved and fade away within a few weeks.
However, if your boil persists for more than a few weeks (or is chronically occurring) and involves severe pain, swollen lymph nodes, fevers / chills and / or loss of appetite, then call your family doctor and have it examined.
Large boils (greater than 2 inches in diameter) should also be looked at by your doctor.
Boils are not considered very serious, but other more serious conditions that can look similar include skin cancer, allergic reactions, wasp or bee stings, diabetic abscess, MRSA, herpes outbreak, and chicken pox.
Applying antibiotic cream (Neosporin, Bacitracin, Polysporin) on boils often is ineffective because it does n't penetrate deep enough into the skin to reach the bacteria.
If your doctor confirms the skin lesion is a boil and not something more serious, then he / she might recommend lancing it if you've been dealing with it for more than a few weeks, or if it's particularly large or painful.
Lancing is a minor in - office procedure in which the doctor applies a local anaesthetic and then makes a small incision into the tip of the boil to release the pus and promote drainage.
The doctor will then bandage it up and send you home with basic cleaning instructions.
Lancing by your doctor is always a much safer alternative to popping the boil at home yourself.
In some cases, large, deep skin infections that ca n't be completely drained by lancing may be packed with sterile gauze to help soak up additional pus.
Depending on the size of the boil, lancing it may leave a small scar on your skin.
This may be a concern if the boil is on your face, so weigh your options with your doctor carefully.
Antibiotic medications are seldom needed to deal with boils, although your doctor may prescribe them if the infection is severe enough or reoccurring.
For people with multiple or recurrent boils, antibiotics are usually prescribed by mouth for 10 or 14 days.
In particularly severe cases, two different antibiotics may be prescribed, plus the use of strong antibiotic ointments to be applied to the skin throughout the day.
Overuse of antibiotics during the last few decades has created many resistant bacterial strains that can be life - threatening.
If you develop a boil or other type of infection while in the hospital for a different ailment, then tell your care givers immediately.
Side effect of antibiotics include destruction of "friendly" bacteria in your intestines, which can lead to poor digestion, diarrhea, abdominal cramps and nausea.
Allergic reactions, rashes and breathing difficulty are also relatively common with antibiotic use.

Home remedies may not help with dark underarms if you're suffering from a condition known as acanthosis nigricans, a skin disorder that results in velvety, light - brown - to - black markings in areas that include the armpits.
This condition can occur as a result of obesity or an endocrine (glandular) disorder.
It is frequently found in people with diabetes or a tendency towards diabetes and is most common among people of African descent.
Other possible causes of acanthosis nigricans include Addison's disease, pituitary gland disorders, growth hormone therapy, hypothyroidism or the use of oral contraceptives.
If your condition is diabetes related, modifying your diet to restrict starches and sugars may help.
If oral contraceptives are at the source of your skin condition, you can try switching to a different form of birth control to see if the condition improves once the medication is stopped.
Retin - A, 20% urea, alpha hydroxyacids, and salicylic acid prescriptions may help, but they've been found to be only minimally effective.
The most widely used ingredient in skin lighteners sold in the U.S. is hydroquinone, which is regulated by the FDA.
Dermatologists can write prescriptions for lighteners that contain up to 4% hydroquinone.
Over-the-counter skin lighteners can contain no more than 2% hydroquinone.
Always check with your doctor before using a product that contains hydroquinone.
Use skin lighteners sold by trusted brands.
Although the FDA banned the use of mercury in skin lightening products in the U.S. in 1990, lightening creams that contain this toxic metal have been found here.
These products were manufactured in other countries but sold in stores in the U.S., so read labels very carefully when shopping for this product.
All women, but especially those with dark skin run the risk of hyperpigmentation (skin darkening) when they use electrolysis for hair removal.
If you've been having electrolysis treatments to remove the underarm hair, stopping the treatment should stop more discoloration from occurring.
Chew your food slowly when you eat.
Avoid chewing gum and sucking on candy.
Cut down on smoking.
Try not to lose friends or alienate coworkers by rejecting their invitations over and over again.
Social outings can be intimidating, especially if they're with people you do n't know well.
You may not always be invited to participate in your idea of a perfect evening.
However, the ability to take part in a wide range of social activities will make you seem more normal and approachable.
The easiest way to do this is to be open to making friends wherever you go.
Try not to worry too much about cliques, or whether someone is your type.
If you get along with them, your friendship will be perfectly natural and normal.
Having friends will make you appear more approachable.
It is natural to be crass with your close friends with whom you feel comfortable.
When aiming to make a good impression, however, try to be more polite.
Meeting someone new is exciting, but there is a natural period of "ice breaker" discussions before you are comfortable with each other.
Do n't bring up intimate, personal topics (like health issues, sexual preferences, traumatic events, etc.) in conversation until you know someone.
While you are getting the feel for a new friend, filter your language to avoid alienating them.
Strong emotions are normal, even desirable.
However, big, outsize displays of emotion (especially anger and sadness) can make people feel uncomfortable.
Strive to regulate your emotional responses to small problems and constructively express your feelings.
Do n't shout, throw things, curse, or become violent.
Whenever possible, express your displeasure calmly, quietly, and politely.
If you get angry easily or have reason to think you're depressed, do n't be afraid to contact a therapist or counselor.
You are n't a "crazy" person for talking to a professional therapist.
They can be simply a helpful voice as you go through a difficult time, or something much more important.
It's normal to have intense opinions about certain things - political issues, for instance.
It's even OK to engage in well - reasoned, sensible debates with other people about these things.
However, if you frequently ridicule or attack people because their opinions are different than yours, you might quickly find yourself a bit of a social pariah.
Instead, try to at least listen to others' opinions and be open - minded.

In common usage, especially in the United States, municipal or municipality, refers to a city or town.
However, in the realm of international law, municipal refers to any sovereign entity, including countries, states, counties, provinces, cities, and towns.
In short, municipal refers to the internal law of a sovereign government.
There are two primary forms of municipal, or domestic, law.
The first is civil law, composed of the statutory law and regulations to administer those laws.
Statutes are passed either by the legislative bodies of the state or by popular vote.
Domestic law is also formed by the common law, which is law handed down by the lower and upper courts of the country.
Common types of municipal law are criminal statutes, traffic laws, and government regulations.
Basically, municipal law regulates the relationship of citizens with the government.
Civil and common law are enforced in very different ways.
For example, law enforcement agencies, ranging from local police to the federal investigative branches, have jurisdiction over civil criminal statutes.
On the other hand, most common law, often called judge - made law, is referred to during legal issues such as contract law or disputes between domestic businesses.
Stress is a major killer of willpower.
When we're overworked and frustrated, we succumb to behaviors we'd rather work against.
By developing good personal habits, we're more likely to stay on track when stressed.
Incorporate certain activities, like working out and studying, into your daily routine.
This can help combat stress.
If activities that take willpower are seen as a necessary part of day - to - day life, like brushing one's teeth at night, you're less likely to shirk on those duties when stressed.
Also, people with good habits are less affected by stress.
Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and a solid sleep schedule can all help lessen how much stressful life events affect you.
Putting off duties that are seen as a burden makes us more likely to not do them at all.
Procrastination is often rooted in perfectionism.
People tend to put things off as they're stressed out about not doing them perfectly.
Understand delaying work does not actually reduce this stress and can actually heighten it.
You're better off just getting to work despite reservations than ruminating over the task at hand.
Journaling can help increase willpower as you can see a log of your progress.
Setbacks will feel less harsh when you can look at them in comparison to your achievements.
Say you gained five pounds over the holidays.
Look back at your journaling from when you started your weight loss journey to remember how far you've come.
No one can do everything.
If you want to sustain your willpower, seek out support from others.
Certain specific tasks, like quitting drinking or smoking, have support groups at hospitals and community centers that can help.
Talk to your friends and family members about what you're trying to accomplish.
Ask them to support you along the way.
If you're trying to cut back on drinking, for example, ask that your family members not drink in front of you.
Drive until your tank is close to empty.
Turn the gas nozzle upside - down when you're done filling up.
Avoid rolling down your windows at high speeds, or using the air conditioning at all.
Park in the shade.
Try to avoid traffic and bad weather.
Turn all electronics and climate control off before you cut the engine.
Reduce the number of times you have to drive by thinking ahead.
After removing the old battery, place the new battery in its place.
If your Samsung Galaxy Tab model has ribbon connectors, make sure you do n't place the battery over the ribbon connectors.
Look for the 4 wires from the battery that are attached to a black clip , Gently press down on the black clip to attach the battery to the board
If the old battery was screwed in place, use a tiny Phillips screwdriver to secure the battery in place using the old screws.
If your Samsung Galaxy Tab has ribbon connectors, lay them over the top of the battery.
Make sure the connector tabs are up and slide the ribbon cables back into place until they are firmly seated.
Press the connector tabs down to lock them in place.
Warning: If the ribbon cables are not firmly seated, it will cause performance problems with your device.
If there was tape covering the ribbon connectors and battery, put the tape back in its place.
After the battery is secure and all cables are properly attached, place the back cover over the back of the unit.
Go around the edges with your fingers and apply a little bit of pressure to snap the back cover back in place.
If your Samsung Galaxy Tab model had screws to the side of the charging port, use the Tri-wing screwdriver to reattach the screws.
Then place the screw covers back over the screws.
Your Samsung Galaxy Tab is now reassembled.
You can power it on.
Sharing more of your emotions with your partner and encouraging your partner to do the same with you will help strengthen your bond.
Make it a habit to confide in each other every day.
Some opening questions for confiding in your partner include: "Remember when we used to go walking and talking around the neighborhood, walking the dogs together?
Let's do that tonight … How about it? "
The best way to uncover what your partner needs, and let them know what you need, is to talk about it.
If you are not sure what your spouse wants or needs, the best way to find out is to ask questions and listen.
If you still are not sure, ask more questions.
For example, you could say something like, "I think that what you need from me is .
Is that what you mean? ", Showing appreciation through sincere compliments is an important part of a healthy relationship
Make sure that you and your partner are aware of the importance of complimenting each other and that you both know how to do it well.
Good compliments should not only be sincere and specific, they should also be phrased as an "I" statement rather than as a "you" statement.
For example, if your partner cleans the kitchen, do n't say "You did a nice job of cleaning the kitchen."
Instead, say "I appreciate that you cleaned the kitchen."
Using I instead of you lets your partner know how you feel, not just that you noticed.
If you decide that you are ready to move forward in your relationship with your partner, you should ask your partner to promise you that they will not follow the same pattern of behavior that led to the affair.
Ask your partner to articulate or even write out what that behavior includes and commit to change.
Since there is a possibility that your partner may cheat again, you should work together to establish consequences for another affair.
These consequences may include things like divorce or other repercussions.
You may want to get these consequences in writing and work with a lawyer to make them legally binding.
If things do n't improve despite all of your best efforts and the help of marriage counseling, you may have to accept that the relationship can not be repaired.
Signs that the relationship may be beyond repair include: Constant fighting; Inability to connect with your partner; Inability to empathize with or receive empathy from your partner; Hurt and anger that does not subside with time; Inability to forgive your partner

If leaving your door open lets in a little light or helps you feel less claustrophobic, for example, then leave your door open to help make your surroundings more comfortable as you try to fall asleep.
If closing the door as you fall asleep helps you feel more secure, then leave it closed as you try to fall asleep.
Anything you can do to make yourself feel comfortable and safe as you fall asleep will contribute to your ability to fall asleep after seeing a movie that scares you, etc. , Scary themes in film, television, etc. are often associated with the dark
If you leave a light on as you try to fall asleep, you can help mitigate your fears and fall asleep more easily.
Too much light while you sleep, though, can actually prove detrimental to your health, so it's best not to make a habit of it.
Leave a night light or small lamp on.
This may give you reassurance without providing too much light and keeping you awake.

This includes the amount of money you will be investing or saving, the length of the term and the proposed interest rates.
You may have several different interest rates that you want to compare.
Divide the number by 100 and then divide this interest rate by 365, the number of days in a year.
This will give you the interest rate to use in the formula.
An annual percentage rate of .5 percent or .005, when divided by 365, is equal to .00137 percent, or .0000137.
If the principle is $10,000, when multiplied by .0000137, it is equal to $.1370.
Rounded up, this account will earn approximately $.14 per day, based on these examples.
Multiply the principal, $10,000, by the annual percentage rate of .5 percent or .005 to calculate interest manually.
The answer is $50.00.
Multiply the daily interest amount of $.1370 by 365 days; the answer is also $50.00.

Graphs can be valuable tools in algebra because they allow you to display ideas that you'd usually need numbers for in easy - to - understand pictures.
Usually, in beginning algebra, graphing problems are restricted to equations with two variables (usually x and y) and are done on a simple 2 - D graph with an x axis and a y axis.
With these equations, all you need to do is plug in a value for x, then solve for y (or do the reverse) to get two numbers that correspond to a point on the graph.
For example, in the equation y = 3x, if we plug in 2 for x, we get y = 6.
This means that the point (2,6) (two spaces to the right of center and six spaces above center) is part of this equation's graph.
Equations with the form y = mx + b (where m and b are numbers) are especially common in basic algebra.
These equations always have a slope of m and cross the y axis at y = b.
What do you do when your equation does n't use an equals sign?
Nothing much different than what you'd normally do, it turns out.
For inequalities, which use signs like > ("greater than") and < ("less than"), just solve as normal.
You'll be left with an answer that's either less than or greater than your variable.
For instance, with the equation 3 > 5x - 2, we would solve just like we would for a normal equation: 3 > 5x - 2 5 > 5x 1 > x, or x < 1.
This means that every number less than one works for x.
In other words, x can be 0, -1, -2, and so on.
If we plug these numbers into the equation for x, we'll always get an answer less than 3.
One algebra topic that many beginners struggle with is solving quadratic equations.
Quadratics are equations with the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are numbers (except that a ca n't be 0.)
These equations are solved with the formula x = [- b + / - √ (b2 - 4ac)] / 2a.
Be careful - the + / - sign means you need to find the answers for adding and subtracting, so you can have two answers for these types of problems.
As an example, let's solve the quadratic formula 3x2 + 2x -1 = 0 , x = [- b + / - √ (b2 - 4ac)] / 2a x = [- 2 + / - √ (22 - 4 (3) (- 1))] / 2 (3) x = [- 2 + / - √ (4 - (- 12))] / 6 x = [- 2 + / - √ (16)] / 6 x = [- 2 + / - 4] / 6 x = -1 and 1/3 Solving more than one equation at once may sound super-tricky, but when you're working with simple algebra equations, it's not actually that hard
Often, algebra teachers use a graphing approach for solving these problems.
When you're working with a system of two equations, the solutions are the points on a graph that the lines for both equations cross at.
For example, let's say we're working with a system that contains the equations y = 3x - 2 and y = - x - 6.
If we draw these two lines on a graph, we get one line that goes up at a steep angle, and one that goes down at a mild angle.
Since these lines cross at the point (- 1, - 5), this is a solution to the system.
If you have a JPEG file with the wrong file extension, such as if a typo has your file ending with ".
JGP "instead of".
JPG, "this method will be useful.
This method will not technically "convert" an image to a JPEG.
If your image file is not already a JPEG file, changing the file extension could break your file.
See other methods if you're hoping to turn a different image file into a JPEG file.
File extensions are not case - sensitive.
JPG and , jpg are the same thing
Before you get started, make a note of the original file extension so that you can change it back if necessary.
It could be on your desktop, as in the example, or in a separate folder you can access through Finder or Windows Explorer.
If you're using Windows, you can skip this step.
Mac users should click once on the image, click "File," then "Get Info."
Click the arrow next to "Name and Extension" and remove the check from "Hide Extension."
Click "Save."
Erase everything after the ".", in the file name
On a Mac, click the image once and press ⏎ Return.
Click at the end of the file extension and press Delete until you've erased everything after the period.
In Windows, right - click the image and select "Rename.", Click at the end of the file extension and press ← Backspace to delete everything after the period
Upper or lowercase is fine.
Whether you're using a Mac or a PC, you'll see a warning about how changing the file extension could make your file unusable.
Click "Use.jpg" or "Yes" if you want to make the change.
Your file name will now end in.
This method works for any device connected to the web, including smartphones and tablets.
Do a web search for "convert XXX to jpg online" (where "XXX" is the type of file you're converting from) to browse through options.
Sites like Online - Convert contain lists of all of the file types it can convert to and from.
Make sure any site you choose is capable of handling your image type.
Some image types, such as.
RAW files, are harder to convert online due to their size.
In your converter, find the button that says something similar to "Choose file" and locate the file you wish to convert.
Note that many converters have maximum file sizes.
Read through the terms or usage policy before uploading.
Some converters allow you to enter a URL, which is great if your image is online.
Most converters will have a dropdown menu or button to press where you can select "JPEG" or ".
JPG "(these two options will do the same thing).
Some converters also allow you to modify the size and quality of the file on this screen.
Find the button that says "Convert" or "Save" to start the conversion.
This could take several minutes.
The image will either download automatically to your default download location or you'll be prompted to choose one.
Once the process is complete, your image will be converted to a JPEG.
Your appearance makes an impression on everyone you meet , This rule applies to any girl that you want to impress
You do n't have to wear a suit to make an impression, but you will have to wear clean and sensible outfits.
Try evaluating what your clothes say about you to judge if you are making a good impression.
Make sure your clothes are clean when you wear them.
Check to make sure your clothes fit well.
Clothes that are too big or small may give you an odd appearance.
Make sure your clothes match or present an image that you think is appropriate.
A huge part of impressing a girl you like is by practicing good personal hygiene.
Chances are, if your hygiene is lacking, you may actually make the wrong impression when being around the girl that has your interest.
Keep some of these basic hygiene tips in mind to help you make a good impression: Take a shower everyday.
Brush your teeth at least once a day.
Keep your fingernails trimmed.
Your body language says a lot, without you ever having to speak a word.
Take a careful look at your body language when you are near the girl you like.
Make sure to keep these tips in mind when you are trying to say the right thing with your body language: Do n't hunch your shoulders down or forward.
Stand up straight at all times, keeping your head up.
Avoid slouching whenever sitting down.
If you are nervous or guarded when you are near a girl you like, you're body language might demonstrate those feelings.
Any kind of "closed off" body language will prevent people from approaching you.
Taking an open and relaxed stance when standing or sitting can help show your confidence and send the message that you are open to interacting with her.
Keep some of these tips in mind when trying to maintain open body language.
Make sure you stand so that you are directly facing her.
Keep your arms down, at your sides.
Avoid crossing your arms or otherwise blocking the other person off.

Plaque is practically invisible, so it can be very difficult to know how much is on your teeth.
To overcome this, you can purchase "disclosing tablets" in the grocery or drugstore.
Once chewed, these tablets will stain the plaque on your teeth bright red, making it easy for you to examine your teeth for plaque and identify the areas you need to target with a toothbrush.
Green food coloring applied to your teeth with a q - tip will have the same effect, staining your teeth green for easy plaque identification.
To effectively brush your teeth and ensure that you are getting rid of as much plaque as possible, it is important that you have the right tools.
Although there are many fancy toothbrushes on the market, the American Dental Association states that any "soft nylon brush with rounded - end, polished bristles" will do the trick.
Hard bristled toothbrushes can be too abrasive and wear away tooth enamel and hurt your gums.
Even if you are not using the correct brushing technique, soft bristles will still be better.
You will also need a good fluoride toothpaste.
Fluoride strengthens teeth and protects them from decay and from the formation of cavities.
Electric toothbrushes are not any more effective at cleaning teeth than regular manually - operated ones.
However, some people find that they are inclined to brush their teeth more regularly and for longer when they own an electric toothbrush, so investing in one may not be a bad idea.
Dentists recommend that you should replace your toothbrush every 3 to 4 months, as they become less effective at cleaning over time.
When brushing your teeth, hold the toothbrush at a 45 degree angle against the gum line and sweep the brush away from the gums, in a short vertical, back - and - forth, or circular motions.
Try not too scrub too hard, as this can actually damage the enamel on your teeth and cause high sensitivity to any type of stimulus.
Pay attention to each tooth as you brush, making sure that you do n't miss any.
Remember to brush the outer surfaces, the inner surfaces and the chewing surfaces, and pay some special attention to those hard to reach teeth at the back.
Brushing your teeth properly should take about two minutes -- try using a stopwatch to get a feel it, and hum a song to yourself to pass the time.
Plaque can easily build up on the surface of the tongue due to food residues, so make sure to give it a little gentle scrub too.
This will also help to freshen your breath.
When you brush your tongue, go from the back to the front of your mouth and repeating the gentle brushing motion 4 or 5 times.
It's ok if you are over whelmed but that should n't stop you from trying to feel better.
You wo n't be able to sustain your willpower if you feel like you're setting impossibly high standards for yourself.
You can increase your willpower by breaking down difficult tasks in small, manageable chunks.
In her memoir Bird By Bird, writer Anne Lamott describes her brother working on a school report cataloguing different types of birds.
What this means, of course, is that enormous tasks can be broken down in manageable chunks.
If you want to get something done and feel overwhelmed, take things bird by bird.
If you have a 20 page term paper, promise yourself to write two pages a day in the weeks leading up to the deadline.
If you want to lose 40 pounds, set a goal of eight pounds lost per month.
If you want to be able to run five miles, use an application like "Couch to 5K" to gradually build your speed and strength over time.
When we break big tasks down into small components, they suddenly seem doable.
If you want to increase your willpower, you need to make deadlines for yourself.
No one can function without a schedule.
Set deadlines that you can reasonably achieve and stick to them.
If you want to, say, start exercising five days a week and you currently do not work out at all, you'll burn out in a week going straight to your goal.
Instead, set a schedule.
Decide to work out two days a week for a week, then move that up to three days, then four days, and then five.
Keep track of your successes.
Invest in a large calendar you can display on the fridge or wall.
Write a small note about your success that day on the calendar.
For example, on October 3rd write something like, "Ran three miles today. , Seeing your success concretely can help you feel a sense of pride that will motivate you to continue
A technique that may help when your willpower is tested is to use an "implementation intention," or an "If, then" statement to plan for situations in which you might face temptation.
For example, you may be trying to give up sugar, but you're going to a birthday party and you know there will be cake there.
Make your plan before the party: "If someone offers me a piece of cake, then I will have some of this fruit salad I am bringing instead."
Having a plan already in place may reduce strain on your willpower, as you have essentially already made the decision and do n't need to battle your desire for sugar in the moment.
This can work even if your self - control has been depleted.
Most healthy, happy dogs are highly sociable creatures.
If your dog is not greeting you as excitedly when you come home – less of a tail wag, less energy and movement – or loses interest in activities they once enjoyed, they may be depressed.
Instead of running to the door to greet visitors, a depressed dog may slink away and find an out - of - the - way corner to curl up and go to sleep.
Be particularly concerned if your dog hides from you.
Dogs that hide are usually injured, sick, or depressed.
On the other hand, depressed dogs sometimes follow their owners around everywhere they go, yet show no desire to interact.
Happy dogs have seemingly endless energy.
For every mile you walk, he goes four – out - and - back, and out - and - back again.
They nag you to throw the ball repeatedly, and your arm grows tired before their enthusiasm runs out.
However, when depressed, your dog no longer pricks their ears up when you get their lead, and instead of charging off across the park, they trudge head - down at your heel.
When you stop to talk to friends, they may sit, or even lie down.
This change from active and energetic to inactive and lethargic may indicate depression.
If your dog wanders from room to room and ca n't find a place to settle down, they may be depressed.
All dogs sleep a lot, particularly when their owners are gone.
However, you should be concerned if your dog continues sleeping when you get home, or if they stay curled up instead of coming to the window or door for things that once attracted them, like the mailman or a passing dog.
Most dogs will eat less and lose weight when depressed.
On the other hand, just like humans, some dogs may eat more as a form of comfort.
Watch for: Refusing treats that they once loved.
Weight gain or weight loss.
Tearing up shoes or chewing on walls, books, furniture, or pillows are often signs of lack of exercise, which may lead to depression.
Depressed dogs may also be more prone to have accidents in the house.
If your dog begins to growl, snap, or otherwise act aggressively when you try to interact with them, this may be a sign of depression.
Look at websites with great designs and think about why they're great designs.
It usually comes down to the information, resources, links, and pages being laid out in a way that is easy to see and use.
To get ideas about how to design your own site, look at sites which do similar things to get ideas about where you should put different types of content.
Stay realistic to your skills.
Ease of access is the most important thing.
If you do n't have a certain piece of information easily visible, make sure that getting to that information is very logical.
Generally the simpler the design, the fewer the pages, the better.
If you already have a fairly good idea about what your website will focus on, skip this step.
If not, here are some things to help you figure that out.
First, understand that there are billions of people on the Internet, and a large percentage have websites.
If you limit yourself to something that has n't been done, you'll never get started.
When you think, "Internet," what is the first thing that comes to your mind?
Those are all good places to start.
You could create a website that's dedicated to your favorite band, and have a chat area where people can talk about it.
You can build a page for your family, but be careful about things like this.
The internet is full of unsavory characters and information you put up about your family could end up being used against you.
Consider adding password protection to your personal family website.
If you're a news junkie, or want something less filtered than traditional media, build a website and get publicly available feeds from news providers such as Reuters, BBC, AP, and others.
Build your own customized news aggregator (what used to go by the quaint name of "newspaper"), then see and show all the news that's fit to digitize.
If you're creative at writing then you can start a blog where you can write about anything you want and attract monthly readers!
Building your website is going to take a commitment of time and possibly money, so set a limit on both, and then dig in.
The plan does n't have to be a big, complicated spreadsheet, or a fancy graphic presentation, but at the very least, you will want to consider what it will do for you and the visitors, what you'll put on the website, what goes where on the webpages.
There are lots of different types of content and many have their own considerations.
You'll need to figure out what's best for your website and your needs.
If you want to sell things, you'll need to figure out how you want the items to be available.
If you have relatively few things to sell, you might want to consider having a store with a hosting service.
Society6, Amazon, and Cafepress are all well - established store hosts which let you sell a variety of items and set your own prices.
Do you want to display videos?
Do you want to host your own files or do you want them hosted somewhere else?
Youtube and SoundCloud are great examples of hosting options, but you'll need to be sure that the way you design your website allows these media types to display correctly.
Are you a photographer?
An artist?
If you plan on putting original images on your website, you might want to use a format that can help keep them from getting stolen.
These are mini-programs which run on your website, usually to help you keep track of who visits, what they're looking for, and where they're from.
You can also find widgets for booking appointments, displaying a calendar, etc. , Look into what might be useful for you (just make sure the widget comes from a reputable source)
Contact information.
Do you want to have contact information on your webpage?
For your own safety, you should be careful about what kind of information you have available.
You should never display things like your home address or home phone number, as information like this can be used to steal your identity.
You may want to set up a PO box or a special email address for people to contact you at, if you do n't have a business address.
For most people, the website starts on the home page.
This is the page that everybody sees when they first go to www.yourSite.com , But where do they go from there
If you spend some time thinking about how people might interact with your site, you'll have a much easier time down the line when you are making navigation buttons and links.
In recent years, smartphones and tablets have become incredibly popular platforms for browsing the internet, and they require websites to be designed for them.
If you really want to make a website that will stand the test of time and be accessible to the highest number of viewers, plan on making different versions of your site for different devices, or plan to use a responsive design that adjusts as necessary.

As your cat gets more comfortable with you, they will demonstrate body language that shows they like you.
Understanding this body language will help you gauge how comfortable your cat is with you.
For example, they may demonstrate head bunting, in which they will lower their head and rub the top of their head against your head or other body part.
This is a clear sign that your cat has affection for you.
Your cat has scent glands near their ears, so head bunting is a way for their to leave their scent on you.
They may also rub their cheek against you to mark you with their scent.
Marking you with their scent is one way of them communicating that they like you.
To show you that they like you, your cat may establish eye contact with you and softly blink.
The eye contact demonstrates that they trust you.
Softly blinking back at them will show them that the trust is mutual.
Imitating some of your cat's body language back to them, such as the head bunting and soft blinking, will deepen your bond with them and show them that you have affection for them.
Other examples of their affectionate body language include soft purring, kneading you with their front paws ("making biscuits"), sitting on your lap, and licking you.
Toys will keep your cat mentally and physically stimulated in your home.
This type of environmental enrichment is a great way to get them to like you.
Your cat may prefer certain toys to others, depending on their personality.
For example, if they like to chase things, they may enjoy toys that dangle from a pole.
If you have an older and / or more sedate cat, she may prefer a toy that she does not have run or chase after, such as a catnip - filled toy that she can play with when laying down.
If you do not want to spend a lot of money on toys, you can also turn common household items into toys for your cat.
For example, empty toilet paper or paper towel rolls and paper bags with the handles removed can be fun for your cat to play with.
Be mindful of toys that your cat should not play with - ribbons, strings, rubber bands - due to the potential of them swallowing them.
Swallowing any of these toys could lead them to getting stuck in, and wrapped around, your cat's intestines.
These medical problems could be even fatal.
Also, be aware of toys that have smaller components, such as plastic eyes, that your cat could remove and potentially swallow.
If you are unsure about which toys would work best for your cat, talk with your veterinarian or visit your local pet store for additional advice.
Your cat is likely very independent and can probably entertain themself.
However, they still need to have regular interactions with you to bond with you and like you.
Cats tend to be most active at dawn and dusk, so it would be good to schedule your playtime with them at these general times of day.
If your work schedule allows for it, schedule play sessions at dawn and dusk, with each session lasting 5 to 15 minutes.
Keep in mind that older or overweight cats may not have the endurance for long play sessions.
No matter what time of day you play with them, make sure that your playtime is at about the same time each day.
This will give them something to look forward to, and will help you develop and maintain regular and positive bonding sessions with them.
You may not realize it, but feeding your cat is an opportunity to bond with them.
In addition, it is very important that your cat see you as their food source.
For these reasons, it is preferable to feed your cat at specific times of day, rather than leaving food out for them all day.
Ideally, the first ingredient of their food should be a protein, such as turkey or chicken.
Because of the wide variety of cat food available at your grocery store and local pet store, consult with your veterinarian to determine which type of food would be best for your cat.
Depending on your cat's age and current health status, some foods may be better for them than others.
How often you feed your cat partially depends on their age.
Kittens up to 6 months of age should be fed 3 times a day.
Twice - daily feedings are good for cats who 6 months of age to 1 year old.
Beyond 1 year of age, once - daily feedings should be sufficient.
Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, can also influence how often you feed your cat.
The amount to feed your cat will depend on several factors, such as their size, activity level, and age.
Although there is no 'one size fits all' approach to how much to feed your cat, there are some general weight - based recommendations for dry food: 5 lbs (1/4 to 1/3 cup), 10 lbs (3/8 to 1/2 cup), and 15 lbs (1/2 to 3/4 cup).
Consult with your veterinarian about the amount and type of food you should feed your cat at feeding time.
Giving your cat the occasional treat can also be a good way to get your cat to like you.
Treats should make up only a small part of your cat's diet (10 to 15% of her daily diet), since they provide little nutritional benefit.
A helpful rule of thumb is to give your cat treats no more than 2 to 3 times per week.
Cat treats are available at your local pet store and grocery store.
In general, do not treat your cat with human food.
In fact, some human foods (e.g., grapes, onions, raisins) are toxic to your cat and should be avoided.
Catnip is an excellent treat for cats.
Treats are useful when rewarding them for good behavior.
Petting is another great way to bond with your cat and get them to like you.
Cats love to be petted near the areas of their scent glands: base of the chin, base of the ears, the cheeks behind the whiskers, and the base of the tail.
Your cat actually derives enjoyment when they rub these areas against you or your furniture to mark their territory.
Similarly, they will love when you pet them in these areas.
Keep in mind that your cat may not want to be petted all the time, or for long periods of time, even when looking relaxed and content.
If their body language tells you that they are overstimulated by petting (dilated pupils, fur twitches, tail wagging like a dog), or they try to move away from you, give them some space to be alone.
Let them dictate how much they're comfortable with you petting them.
When you pet them, gently stroke your hand in the areas where they like to be petted.
You can even talk to them in a calm and soothing voice to make the experience more enjoyable for the both of you.
In addition to petting your cat, consider brushing and grooming her, if they will let you.
Brushing and grooming are ways for you to learn the areas in which your cat likes, and does not like, to be touched.
This is especially useful if you have a timid or anxious cat.
Keeping your interactions quiet and calm will help them warm up to you and become more comfortable with you.
Examples of quiet interactions include sitting quietly on the floor or reading a book on the couch when they're in the room with you.
This will help reduce swelling and dry up or draw out any infection that might be present in the gum boil.
It does n't matter if some remains in the bottom of the glass.
Use the saltwater as you would your usual mouthwash, but be careful to keep a special emphasis on the infected site when you're rinsing.
Do not swallow the saltwater.
Continue washing with the salt washes once or twice a day for a week to help heal the boil.
This will reduce chances of it coming back.
At the same time, be sure to maintain a good dental hygiene routine.
This method is recommended by oral health professionals and is clinically proven to be effective, but is not a replacement for a visit to your dentist.
Applying essential oils topically to a gum boil can help reduce the levels of bacteria present and improve the overall tissue health.

Simply add a few drops of the essential oil to a glass of water and rinse your mouth thoroughly.
Some good essential oils to choose are spearmint or peppermint oils.
Remember that this is a recommended home remedy and has not been proven effective with scientific evidence.
Consuming raw onions can be a very effective home remedy for treating gum boils.
Onions contain relatively high levels of sulfur, which can help heat up and dry up existing boils in your mouth.
This is a home remedy and may be less effective than other solutions that have been verified by medical professionals.
If you do n't like the taste of raw onions, try eating them on other things - like in salads or on sandwiches where the flavor is masked.
Do n't cook the onions as this can reduce the amount of sulfur present in the vegetable.

In your mind, think about how you would describe this object to another person.
What is its shape?
How would you describe its contours?
Does it remind you of anything?
Where did you obtain this object?
From whom?

Knowing what your cat does not like will help you avoid doing the things that could jeopardize your bond with them.
Unlike dogs, cats generally do not like belly rubs.
In fact, if you try to rub their belly, they may instinctively react defensively by extending their claws and trying to bite you.
In the wild, cats are aware that they can be predator and prey at the same time.
The belly houses the most vital organs, so if you reach for their belly when they're unaware of your harmless intentions, their prey mentality might be triggered and they may do all they can to protect that area of their body.
When your cat is stretched out and showing their belly, they may feeling very relaxed and comfortable in their environment.
However, they might be demonstrating defensive behavior.
Even though some cats may not mind their bellies being rubbed, it is best to avoid this area and pet your cat only in the areas where you know they enjoy being touched.
As mentioned before, follow your cat's lead when it comes to how much they want to interact with you.
Forcing them to play with you, or trying to pet them when they do not want be petted, will probably make your cat like you less.
They may even become fearful of you because they do not trust that you will respect their space.
Just as your cat can show you affectionate body language (e.g., purring, head bunting), they can also let you know when they've had enough and want to be alone.
For example, if they start growling, hissing, or spitting, give them some space and alone time until they calm down.
Your cat may also simply become physically tired from playing and will probably stop on their own.
Physically punishing your cat is not effective, since they will not be able to make a direct association between their behavior and your punishment.
Instead, consider giving them a timeout, during which you simply leave the room without talking to them or interacting with them.
Soon enough, they will realize that certain behaviors result in you not interacting with them (a negative result in their mind) and will discontinue those behaviors.
Physically punishing your cat will likely make them fearful and wary of you.
Rather than yelling at them, you can try giving them a firm 'no' in a stern voice when they demonstrate bad behavior.

Hibiscus plants are n't that particular about their soil mix, but they prefer lightweight material such as loam and peat moss.
A regular bag of potting soil will usually work just fine, You can create their ideal soil conditions by mixing 1 part garden loam, 1 part peat moss, and 1 part fine sand or bark
A mix of 1 part coarse peat, 1 part composted bark, and 1 part composted manure mixed with a little bit of leca and vermiculite is also a great soil mix for hibiscuses.

These plants need lots of water, especially during the warmest months when they're blooming.
Check the soil moisture each day by touching the top of the soil.
If it feels dry, your plant needs to be watered.
If it feels damp and slightly spongy, the soil is wet enough.
Overwatering can cause root rot, so always touch the soil before watering.
Never use cold water on hibiscus plants.
They like their water to be around 95 °F (35 °C) , Use a thermometer or touch the water with your hand before administering it to check the temperature
Avoid using water that's much hotter than 95 °F (35 °C), since they do n't like overly warm water either.
Hibiscuses will grow without direct sunlight, but they wo n't bloom without at least 1 to 2 hours of direct sunlight every day.
Keep the plants 1 in (2.5 cm) to 2 in (5.1 cm) away from the window glass, since the hot glass can damage their foliage and blooms.
With the proper amount of sunlight, hibiscus plants will bloom from spring until fall.
Hibiscus plants flower from spring until fall, and weekly fertilizing will result in more abundant blooms.
Apply a slow - release fertilizer (like 20-20-20 or 10-10-10) or a specially formulated hibiscus fertilizer around the base of the plant.
Look for a fertilizer with trace elements like iron and magnesium, which support growth and blooming.
You can also mix up a weak solution of water - soluble fertilizer (half strength or less) and dose your plants with a little fertilizer each time you water them.
Avoid over-fertilizing since too much phosphorus can kill hibiscus plants.

You'll need this to convert into other currencies.
Free up cash by selling your other assets.
Consider selling stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, or take money out of a checking or savings account.
In most cases, individual investors use a brokerage service to place their foreign currency transaction.
Online broker OANDA offers a user - friendly retail platform called fxUnity for novices that want to buy and sell foreign currency.
The online brokerage firms Forex.com and TDAmeritrade also allow you to trade on the Forex market.
Forex brokers do n't charge traditional commissions or fees.
Instead, they make money off the spread, which is the difference between how much a currency can be sold for and bought for.
The higher the spread is, the more money you pay to the broker.
For example, a broker that will buy a U.S. dollar for 0.8 euros but sells a U.S. dollar for 0.95 euros has a spread of 0.15 euros.
Before you sign up for a brokerage account, check its website or the website of its parent company and ensure it's registered with the Futures Commission Merchant and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
You should be able to track the progress of your investments with visual software or other resources.
Do not "overtrade," or purchase too much currency at once.
Experts recommend sticking with investing between 5% and 10% of your total account balance in any single currency trade.
Pay attention to currency rate trends before you make the transaction.
You have a better chance of making money if you trade with the trend than against it.
For example, say that the U.S. dollar has been steadily rising in value against the euro.
Unless you have a good reason to think otherwise, you should choose to sell euros and buy U.S. dollars.
Stop - loss orders are a crucial part of currency trading.
A stop - loss order will automatically exit a position -- i.e., sell off your trade -- once it hits a certain price.
This limits the amount of loss you take if the currency you purchased begins to take a nosedive.
For example, if you are purchasing Japanese Yen with the US Dollar and the Yen is currently ¥120, you could set a stop - loss order for a certain price threshold, such as $1 hitting ¥115.
The opposite of this is the "take - profit" order, which is set up to automatically sell out when you have hit a certain profit.
For example, you could set a "take - profit" order to automatically cash out when $1 hits ¥125.
This would guarantee you the profit made from the sale at that point.
In many countries, you will need a record of this information for annual income tax filing.
Note the price that you paid for the currency, the price you sold the currency for, the date that you bought the currency, and the date that you sold the currency.
Most major brokerage firms will send you an annual statement that contains this information in case you did n't collect it yourself.
In general, because currency trading is so fraught, experts recommend that you limit the amount of currency trading you do to a small percentage of your overall portfolio.
If you do end up on the wrong end of the deal - as 70% of retail currency trades do - limiting how much you trade, and how much of your portfolio currency trades represent, will help limit the damage.
There are many reasons why your period may not have come.
If pregnancy is at the top of your worry list, you'll need to take a pregnancy test and decide what to do next.
Most pregnancy tests do n't give an accurate reading until five or more days have passed since your period was supposed to begin.
If no more than 120 hours (5 days) have passed since you had sex, emergency contraception is an option for you.
Also called Plan B or the morning after pill, emergency contraception is a drug containing high levels of progestin.
This hormone works by stopping the release of the egg from the ovary, preventing it from getting fertilized.
The sooner you take it, the more effective it is.
If more than 120 hours have passed or you take a pregnancy test that reads positive, emergency contraception will not work.
Whether you choose to have an abortion or continue the pregnancy, it's important to get support right away.
This is highly dangerous and could result in permanent injury or death.
Call or visit a health clinic to learn about safe options.
Having an irregular cycle is completely normal for some.
Everyone's body is different, and some people tend to skip a month here and there or go long periods of time without menstruating.
Breast - feeding and menopause are other natural conditions that disrupt the menstrual cycle.
Talk with your doctor if you're unsure whether the cause of your missed period may be connected with natural hormone changes.
Most women menstruate every 21 to 35 days , The length of time between your periods can change over time as your body grows and changes
Just because you miss one period does n't mean something is wrong.
However, if it happens more than once you should talk to your doctor.
Menopause naturally occurs around the age of 50, although it can happen earlier.
The hormone levels in your body drop, causing periods to become irregular and eventually stop altogether.
It depends on how frequently the baby nurses, how much milk you're producing, and a number of other factors.
If you are on one of the following types of medication, it could be the reason your period is late: Antipsychotics; Antidepressants; Blood pressure drugs; Allergy medications; Chemotherapy. It's normal to miss a period every now and then, but if it has been months since you last menstruated, it's important to see your doctor to make sure you're in good health.
Certain underlying conditions can cause a disruption in your cycle.
The following conditions may be the culprit: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which causes your body to produce high levels of hormones instead of the normal fluctuations that bring about your period.
Thyroid malfunction or hypothyroidism, which can affect how often you have your period.
A benign tumor in your pituitary gland can interfere with your hormones as well.
Some people experience premature menopause, which is defined as menopause that occurs before age 40.
Structural issues in your reproductive system can also cause the absence of periods.
Uterine scarring, a lack of reproductive organs, or other abnormalities may be the source of the problem.

Before you start, have everything ready.
Sponge cakes are time sensitive cakes, so you do n't want to measure ingredients or wait on the oven to heat while you're in the middle of mixing.
Measure all the ingredients and have them nearby before you begin.
Sift the baking powder into the flour before you begin.
Preheat the oven to 375ºF (190 °C.)
Line the pan with butter before beginning.
As an alternative to butter or cooking spray, use parchment paper.
Parchment paper is a grease and moisture - resistant paper.
When using parchment paper, no butter or cooking sprays are needed because cakes, cookies, or other baked goods wo n't stick.
It also helps with clean up, since you will have no leftover batter to wash.
If using parchment paper, cut a piece of paper into the shape and size of the bottom of the pan.
You can also line the sides of the pan with paper, or you can use cooking spray or butter.
You can use a round pan, an angel food cake pan, or any other type of pan.
Bake at 375ºF for 30 to 35 minutes.
Every oven is different, so as the cake approaches 30 to 35 minutes, you need to begin watching it.
Check to see if the cake is done by gently touching with your finger.
It will spring back if it is done.
If you are still unsure, insert a toothpick or fork into the center of the cake.
If the cake is clean, it is done.
After removing from the oven, let it cool for 15 to 20 minutes before removing cake from the cake pan.
If you used butter or spray on the pan, loosen around the edges with a knife, then flip cake and place on a serving plate
Especially if you are from another culture, you may have trouble establishing a support network when you are new to an area.
Look for those who come from a similar background.
While you acclimate to your new environment, you will benefit from being around people who know where you are coming from.
This can help you feel normal, supported, and understood.
Try searching for meetup groups online, looking for groups at your local community center, collegiate cultural groups, or ask at your place of worship.
Trying not to stand out negatively seems to have much to do with clothing.
Beyond wearing the costume of the culture in which you live, try not to look more or less casual than those around you.
This is especially important in the workplace, but advisable in social circles as well.
Mirroring can help build your self - esteem – when you see yourself reflected in the dress or behavior of someone you like and admire, it can increase your confidence and lessen your insecurities.
Until you start feeling confident and comfortable taking more risks with your wardrobe, the affirmation provided by mirroring can help you feel less vulnerable and more connected to your peers.
Adjusting to your surroundings does n't only apply to new cultures, but everyday situations as well.
When entering a room, observe others in the room.
If everyone seems to be experiencing a strong emotion, do n't do something typically associated with the opposite emotion.
You can further upset and alienate a room of people crying by telling a lewd joke.
Notice the body language and expressions of those in the room.
Are they open and smiling?
Or are they closed off and frowning?
Do they appear relaxed and at ease, or rigid and tense?
Are people speaking in hushed tones, at a normal volume, or shouting or laughing loudly?
Part of getting people to feel like you're "one of them" is simply behaving similarly.
Be careful with this, though.
Just because an activity is a norm, it does n't mean that everyone is not in the wrong.
Stay away from unsafe or unhealthy behaviors, like binge drinking, or doing illegal drugs, even if it means you do n't quite fit in.
If everyone in your group is obsessed with football, try taking an interest, too.

A little heavy make - up or concealer can be pretty effective for covering up a hickey.
Just make sure you get a color that matches your skin tone, and to blend it in.
Stage make up is extra thick and heavy, so you may resort to that if you're trying to conceal a real whopper.
A scarf is your best friend when attempting to conceal a hickey on your neck, as a scarf is a fashionable item which no one will question you wearing (unless it's 100 degrees outside).
Wrap the scarf strategically around your neck, and make sure to check it in a mirror from time to time to make sure the material has n't moved, leaving your hickey exposed.
Other options for covering a neck hickey include wearing a turtleneck (again, when weather conditions allow) or wearing your hair down, if it's long enough.
Arnica cream is said to speed up the healing of bruises, so it may also be effective for clearing up hickeys.
There are numerous other home remedies that supposedly help to speed up healing, such as applying an ice pack, rubbing the hickey with a comb, scraping the hickey with a coin and covering the hickey with toothpaste.
Choose earth tones and deep colors if you have warm undertones.
Opt for blues and paler colors if you have cool undertones.
Try any color if you have neutral undertones.
Do n't wear shoes, and stand tall.
Stand on a scale that has been calibrated and get your weight in pounds or kilograms.
Once you find a credible BMI table, locate where your height and weight measurements intersect.
The number listed at the intersection is your BMI, or your body mass index.
Get an online BMI table here.
Our BMI tends to naturally rise slightly as we age.
Children and Teen BMI readings: you must calculate the child's BMI using an age - and gender - appropriate table.
Otherwise, the results will be inaccurate.
You can also use an online calculator to calculate BMI.
Your BMI is a ratio of your body height and weight, your "mass."
Your body is made of fat, bones, blood, muscle, and many other tissues that contribute to your weight, and your BMI.
Your BMI rating does not directly correlate to your percentage of body fat, but is a way to monitor your size.
Below are listed ranges for medical weight classes for adults.
A number of extremely muscular, not fat, individuals fall in the overweight category because their muscle weighs so much.
Talk to your doctor about what your BMI means for you.
If you are not exercising and growing muscle mass but are gaining weight, it is likely that weight is fat.
If you are exercising and eating healthily, while gaining weight, it is possible that weight is muscle and only partially fat.
If you are losing weight, you are probably losing both muscle and fat.
To start learning algebra, you'll need to know basic math skills such as adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing.
This primary / elementary school math is essential before you start learning algebra.
If you do n't have these skills mastered, it will be tricky to tackle the more complex concepts taught in algebra.
If you need a refresher on these operations, try our article on basic math skills.
You do n't necessarily need to be great at doing these basic operations in your head to do algebra problems.
Many algebra classes will allow you to use a calculator to save time when doing these simple operations.
You should, however, at least know how to do these operations without a calculator for when you are n't allowed to use one.
One of the trickiest things about solving an algebra equation as a beginner is knowing where to start.
Luckily, there's a specific order for solving these problems: first do any math operations in parentheses, then do exponents, then multiply, then divide, then add, and finally subtract.
To recap, the order of operations is: Parentheses; Exponents; Multiplication; Division; Addition; Subtraction. The order of operations is important in algebra because doing the operations in an algebra problem in the wrong order can sometimes affect the answer.
For instance, if we're dealing with the math problem 8 + 2 × 5, if we add 2 to 8 first, we get 10 × 5 = 50, but if we multiply 2 and 5 first, we get 8 + 10 = 18.
Only the second answer is correct.
In algebra, it's common to use negative numbers, so it's smart to review how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide negatives before starting to learn algebra.
Below are just a few negative number basics to keep in mind - for more information, see our articles on adding and subtracting negative numbers and dividing and multiplying negative numbers.
On a number line, a negative version of a number is the same distance from zero as the positive, but in the opposite direction.
Adding two negative numbers together makes the number more negative (in other words, the digits will be higher, but since the number is negative, it counts as being lower); Two negative signs cancel out - subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a positive number; Multiplying or dividing two negative numbers gives a positive answer.
Multiplying or dividing a positive number and a negative number gives a negative answer.
While simple algebra problems can be a snap to solve, more complicated problems can take many, many steps.
To avoid errors, keep your work organized by starting a new line every time you make a step toward solving your problem.
If you're dealing with a two - sided equation, try to write all the equals signs ("=" s) underneath each other.
This way, if you make a mistake somewhere, it'll be much easier to find and correct.
For example, to solve the equation 9/3 - 5 + 3 × 4, we might keep our problem organized like this: 9/3 - 5 + 3 × 4 9/3 - 5 + 12 3 - 5 + 12 3 + 7 10
Hold yourself accountable.
Manage negative thoughts.
Dogs are routine driven, so the most common trigger for canine depression is a change of routine.
Changes in routine that can trigger depression may include: Stress: In doggy terms stress includes anything that stops him from getting the attention he is used to.
A stay - at - home owner who now goes out to work.
A new baby, or puppy, in the household.
The sudden loss of a companion (human or canine).
Moving house.
Major building work or renovations in the home.
Go for more walks, play games your dog likes (fetch, tug - of - war), try a canine sport like agility, train your dog to do tricks, head to the dog park.
When you watch TV, sit on the floor at your dog's level instead of in a chair.
Whatever you decide to do, make sure it is fun for both you and your dog.
Spending enjoyable time with you is the best way to help your dog overcome his depression.
If your dog has recently lost a canine companion, consider getting a new one.
If your dog is home alone for long hours, try daycare a few days a week or having a walker come by.
Also plan trips to the park so that your dog can socialize.
The mistake many owners make when dealing with a depressed dog is that they fuss over them when the dog is behaving abnormally.
For example, if you make a fuss out of your dog when they do n't eat, you inadvertently send them the message that they are doing a clever thing by not eating.
A much better way of handling the situation is to put the food bowl down and ignore the dog until they decide to eat.
Then once they take a mouthful, heap them with praise.
This reinforces positive rather than negative behaviors and will help to lift your dog from their depression.
Try to keep a depressed dog in their regular routine, since this helps them feel secure, and reassures them that all is well with the world.
It is possible that your dog has a chemical imbalance and may need drugs like Prozac, as well as a behavioral modification program, to overcome their depression.
Initially, because of your own sunny attitude, you might not be alert to the pessimistic bent of another person.
It is helpful to understand these patterns in order to be able to detect them in yourself.
Signs of negative thinking include: Thinking that things are n't going to work out well.
This is also known as catastrophizing, or thinking the worst will happen.
Believing that the negative outcomes are permanent and inescapable.
May blame self or others for things not turning out well.
A possible reason for the existence of pessimistic thinking is depression.
If this is the case, the pessimist may need psychological or medical treatment.
See How to cope with depression for an explanation of the symptoms.
If you are concerned that your friend or family member has a mental health issue you can express your worry to her and offer treatment as an option.
Simply say, "I noticed you seem sad (or angry, or negative) lately, have you ever considered talking to a professional about it?
I think this might help.
"Be careful not to be pushy or you may scare her off.
The more you know, the less personal it might feel when pessimistic thinking is around you.
With education comes understanding and an increased ability to cope.
One option is to read the book, Learned Optimism, by Martin Seligman.
Dr. Seligman is a psychologist and expert in the field of positive psychology.
Keep the dog in the quiet spot, so he can rest and you can keep a close eye on him.
Make sure that the dog does not participate in any activity such as running or playing.
If the dog shakes its head or scratches due to sensations from the wound, he can re-open the wound and cause further bleeding.
Another potential complication from vigorous head shaking or scratching is the formation of an aural hematoma, which is a blood clot between the layers of the ear.
This happens when a blood vessel beneath the skin and cartilage breaks and bleeds into the ear cartilage.
The ear will swell like a pillow , These need to be treated by a veterinarian
You can minimize the dog's desire to shake its head by carefully cleaning the ear and ear canal.
Remove any bothersome blood or debris in the canal or inside the ear.
You will need to sacrifice a stocking for this option.
Cut the toe off the stocking to form a tube.
Fold the ears back over the head, using a piece of gauze on the wound.
Carefully slide the stocking over the head.
Make sure the fit is snug but not too tight.
You should easily be able to fit a finger under the stocking both on the head and the neck.
Leave the bandage on for a day, then remove it and check the ear wound.
If needed, you can replace it for another day as long as it remains clean and dry.
If you have lingering pain or other methods do n't alleviate your back pain, take an over the counter medication.
However, if you experience continued discomfort, consult your doctor.
Take ibuprofen or another type of NSAID (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) to help relieve your back pain.
Pain relievers are also good for other symptoms of dysmenorrhea such as headaches.
Because birth control pills often contain hormones and control a woman's menstrual cycle, taking them may help alleviate pain associated with your period.
Consult with your doctor about taking the pill, which may help to relieve your back pain.
Skipping the placebo, or pill - free, week, may also help manage back pain.
You need a prescription to get birth control pills, so you'll need to schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss your options.
However, medical professionals agree that quinine is dangerous and can cause a numerous health problems such cardiac arrhythmia, nausea, headaches, and tinnitus.

Prepare two bowls: one for the whites, and one for the yolks.
Break the egg open over your hand.
Separate your fingers just enough so the whites drip through, while the yolk remains in your hand.
If the yolk starts to break, close your fingers to keep the yolk and whites separate.
Place the yolk in the other bowl.
The eggs are easier to separate when they are cold because both parts seem to hold their shape better.
Leave the eggs out for half an hour so they can warm to room temperature before starting the recipe.
Make sure your hands are clean and all soap and oil have been removed.
The smallest amount of grease, oil, or egg yolks can cause the whites not to stiffen.
After removing the cake from the oven, let it cool for almost an hour.
Then use a spatula or a knife to separate the cake from the sides of the pan, and then remove onto a serving platter.

You can do this by asking a few friends or family members to try it out.
Give them a specific task like "edit your profile" or "buy an alpaca sweater from the bargains page."
Sit behind them and watch them navigate - do not help them.
You will likely find areas where you need to improve navigation or clarify some instructions.
Alternately use something like zurb.com to user test on specific demographics for different types of engagement.
When testing a website in 2014 it's becoming important to keep the platform in mind and make sure the website is usable from smartphones and tablets as well as desktops.

Shop for shoes at the end of the day when your feet are at their most swollen.
Shoes should fit your feet well, even when they're at their largest.
Try to maintain a healthy weight for your height through diet and exercise.
Additional pounds can put pressure on your feet and strain your blood vessels, particularly if you're active.
Even losing a pound or two will decrease everyday foot swelling.
Your doctor can advise you on a healthy weight range for you.
Opt for high heels shorter than two inches and try not to wear them often.
High heels can pinch your feet, and they put lots of pressure on the ball of your foot.
Putting so much weight on a small area like this can cause swelling, pain and even displace bones.
If you want to wear high heels, a chunky heel rather than a stiletto will provide more stability.
Smoking taxes your heart and makes circulating your blood more difficult.
Particularly since your feet are so far from your heart, they can get swollen and shiny as a result.
Your skin can even start to thin.
Consider a regimen to quit smoking to improve your overall health as well as the health of your feet.
Rub the sole of your foot with a rolling pin to get your blood moving.
You can even ask a partner to rub the soles of your feet, which will increase circulation and clear pooled blood.
Use your fingers to massage any areas of tightness or discomfort.
If your doctor has ruled out more serious conditions, it is usually safe to take over-the-counter anti-inflammatories to manage foot swelling.
Take 200 to 400 milligrams of ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours as needed to diminish puffiness and reduce discomfort.
Always check with your doctor before taking any medication.
Some medications and medical conditions may interact with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.
Participate in social activities.
Cultivate an active social life.
Control your emotions.
Moderate your opinions.
If you can reduce the amount that you worry about what other people think about you, you'll be happier and less stressed.
You'll also appear more normal because you'll be more confident about yourself.
The less you worry about being normal, the more confident you will be (and appear).
New evidence shows that striking a "power pose" can change your brain chemistry, releasing testosterone, which makes you feel powerful, and reducing cortisol, a hormone related to feeling stressed.
Confident body language means you "open" yourself up.
Uncross your arms and legs, pull your shoulders back – do n't assume the hunched or closed - off posture that increases your stress hormones.
Before entering into a situation that makes you feel nervous (a new social setting, a classroom, an interaction with people who have ridiculed you), go somewhere private and strike a power pose for at least two minutes.
Try the "Wonder Woman" pose: throw your shoulders back and place your hands on your hips, place your feet shoulder - width apart, and hold your head up high.
Even imagining yourself in a confident, powerful pose can make a difference.
Picture yourself sitting with your legs propped up on the table, leaning back in your chair with your hands behind your head.
Try standing always with your shoulders back and a hand on your hip.
If you find yourself wondering, for example, if your cell phone holster is abnormal, step back and evaluate it.
If it is a necessary evil for your job or lifestyle, it seems like a logical accessory to have.
If you could just as easily keep your cell phone in your pocket, maybe it is not worth putting that out there for people to judge.
These rationalizations will make you more deliberate in your habits and actions, and therefore more confident.
You should be aware of the way you interact with others, but know that others are less aware of your idiosyncratic tendencies.
As you are working on this, try to ask questions and let others do the talking.
Tend toward conversation topics you are comfortable with, so you feel the spotlight less.
Indeed, you do n't need to be tall and skinny to fit in.
However, diet and exercise can go a long way towards improving the way your body feels and functions.
Try to eat a healthy mix of proteins, carbs, fruits, vegetables, and fats every day.
You do n't have to be a health freak to be healthy – it's okay to eat a single ice cream cone or a bag of potato chips every once in a while.
Just try not to overindulge.
Your occasional treats will be more meaningful if you eat them sparingly.
If you spend lots of time watching TV, get off the sofa and get some fresh air!
Ride your bike, swim, or take a walk.
Physical activity will keep you healthy and in shape.
Many people are resistant to change.
However, trying new things is vital for expanding our horizons.
Whether you end up liking it or not, you'll learn something about yourself and the activity.
Try out a new hobby with a friend so you are more comfortable.
If you're not a weight lifter by practice, you should go slowly when lifting someone.
Lifting with your legs can reduce the risk of back strain, but it does not completely eliminate it.
Go slowly when lifting.
Pay attention to your body.
If you feel strained, you should stop.
The fireman's carry is primarily used to transport injured victims during emergencies and accidents.
You should avoid using it if you do not have professional training.
You could inadvertently make someone's injuries worse.
Only use the fireman's carry for fun.
Not everyone likes being picked up.
Even if you've been dating a girl for awhile, she may not find being carried fun or romantic.
Make sure to ask if it's okay beforehand, especially if you've never lifted her before.
You should also pay attention to body language.
If she's standing with her arms folded or stepping back, you may be invading her personal space.
For a lot of reasons, a girl may dislike being picked up in public.
Some people are uncomfortable with public displays of affection.
Also, if the girl is wearing a short skirt, you do not want to accidentally expose her underwear while picking her up.
A girl wearing a short skirt may want to keep her hand on her skirt when being picked up.
Before picking a girl up in public, ask her if it's okay first.
If you're going to be altering your existing birth control plan or workout routine, always talk to your doctor ahead of time.
For instance, it's usually safe to manipulate how you take your birth control to delay your period.
However, you should ask your doctor about occasionally delaying your period when you are prescribed birth control, and see if she thinks it's safe for you given your health and medical history.
Delaying your period is not a means to guard against pregnancy.
Unless you are on birth control pills or have a device like an IUD, you are not protected against pregnancy because you managed to miss or delay your menstrual period.
Use protection (like condoms) and know the common signs of pregnancy.
If you deliberately delay or miss a period, it may be harder to tell if you're pregnant as a missed period is usually the first sign.
Pregnancy can also be marked by breast tenderness, fatigue, and nausea.
Watch for signs of pregnancy and take a pregnancy test if you have any symptoms.
Skipping the inactive pills if you're on a 28 - day pack should not decrease the overall effectiveness of your existing birth control.
However, birth control pills do not protect against STIs, so unless you and your partner have both been tested, you should still use condoms.

Brushing your teeth regularly (at least twice a day) is probably the single most important thing you can do to prevent gum boils, as well as other conditions such as receding gums, and to contribute positively to your general oral health.
Brushing helps reduce bacteria and germs that are present in your mouth, as well as removing plaque and food particles.
Use a toothbrush with soft bristles and talk your dentist about proper brushing technique your teeth daily
Flossing is one of the best ways to help reduce plaque and bacteria buildup in your mouth.
Since overall oral health is crucial for preventing gum boils, it is very important to floss regularly - especially if you have trouble with chronic or recurring gum boils.
Most dentists recommend that you floss twice daily.
Since bacterial buildup is one of the main causes of gum boils, it is important to do everything possible to minimize the amount of bad bacteria in your mouth.
A good way to do this is to incorporate an antibacterial mouth rinse into your daily oral care regimen , use it after flossing and before going to bed
Just make sure that the packaging indicates the product is antibacterial and look for the American Dental Association seal to ensure you're purchasing a quality product.
The best way to prevent gum boils is to maintain proper and consistent oral care , This includes regular visits to the dentist for cleanings and checkups
Your dentist or dental hygienist can help remove any plaque buildup and they can also let you know if they see any problems or recommend any specific courses of action.
Your dentist can also probably spot signs of tooth decay or other periodontal problems much earlier than you can, so this will help you spot symptoms or causes of gum boils early on.
Regular dental visits should occur twice a year (once every six months).
If you're doing this for money, which ideas stand to make the most profit?
Which ideas require the most commitment?
Which ideas look like they'd be fun to pursue?
You will be spending time working on your website, so choose the idea you are most passionate about (that is also profitable and practical for you).
The website you create may be for fun, it may be for profit, or some combination of the two.
Knowing your expectations makes it much easier both to design your website, and to track and make sense of the results.
Content sites require less investment but they also face more competition, since anyone can start a content site.
To make money from this kind of site, you provide information and generate income from the traffic you receive through advertising, such as through Google AdSense.
In order to optimize AdSense, you will have to write your content purposefully and make it interesting so that people come to your site.
Use specific keywords directed at people searching for specific terms too; just do n't get carried away with this aspect or the content may suffer and readers wo n't like it.
eCommerce sites, which sell products, will need more maintenance and attention.
You will need to think about shipping, sales, taxes, SSL, inventory updates, and everything that a person with a brick - and - mortar storefront would have to manage.
A system for prompt answering of questions and dealing with complaints is essential when selling products online; many companies also offer phone help, which you can outsource offshore if need be.
If the goal is just to add a stream of income, you can also sell other people's products through affiliate programs, letting you earn money without investing in product or worrying about shipping.
Which kinds of people will your website serve?
Conduct market research to figure out more about your audience.
Things to know or find out include: What do they do?
What are their other interests?
All of this information can help make your website much more useful.
However, be careful of assuming that your site is only targeting one group – – always watch for trends that show other types of people becoming interested, so that you can cater for their interests too and make the most of new opportunities.
This is necessary to determine whether people are searching for topics that are relevant to your site and can be useful for learning more about your potential clients.
Making a conscious effort to incorporate in - demand keywords into the site can also help you get a better search engine ranking.
There are tools available from Google (ex , google.com/trends/ and google.com/insights/search/#), Overture, and third - party software developers that can make the keyword research process easier
Sprinkle the keywords you've chosen throughout your text, but not insofar as it hurts the quality of your content.
Creating pages that are optimized for the search engines will help you get your site found which is really more important than design.
What good is a site that no one sees?
Submit your site to major search engines.
There are sites that will do this for you, or you can do it yourself.
Tweet about it - constantly!
Add it to your Facebook status updates, post pictures of it on Flickr, add it to your LinkedIn account - anywhere and everywhere is the key here.
The more people coming to your site, the better.
Use an e-mail address with your domain.
Visit other websites that complement (not compete with) yours, and offer to exchange links or guest blog / write.
Post constructively on blogs and forums, and put your URL in your signature.
Creating SEO - optimized articles and posting them to other sites is a sometimes a useful way to create back - links to your website.
This might help you to boost your website's search engine ranking but always keep abreast of search engine updates that often impact SEO strategies and can render them less helpful or even downgrade your site's ranking.
Most of all, listen to your readers and customers and learn from their experience with your website.
Other band members, fans, and friends may all have easier navigation ideas.
Think about your target market or audience: their needs, their frustrations, their circumstances.
As much as possible, seek to make their lives easier or more informed.
Suck on a throat lozenge or cough drop.
Use an antihistamine.
Try a pain reliever.
Use throat spray.
Rather than release the fart quickly, which will likely cause a loud fart noise, take your time and release the fart slowly.
Do this by squeezing your abdominal muscles and taking long inhales and exhales as you release the fart.
Or spread your buttcheeks as far as you can from each other to make a smooth, wavy fart that can sometimes have no scent at all.
You can distract from your fart by coughing loudly or sneezing as you fart.
This can help to cover up the noise as you fart.
You could also make a loud noise by pretending to talk on your cell phone or turning up the music in the room before you release the gas , This could muffle the noise that inevitably comes with farting
Another option is to fart while you are on the move so that the sound and smell do not linger in your general vicinity.
Doing this will allow you to be absent when someone smells the fart or hears it and not have to assume any guilt when the smell of your fart is discovered.
Try to walk towards an empty room or area so that you can finish farting when no one else is around you.
That way, you will not need to feel embarrassed about releasing uncomfortable gas.
Before you fart, get up and try to vacate the area so you are not in a crowd or around a lot of people.
That way, you can go into another room or area and fart to your heart's content.
If you are on a crowded train, for example, try to get over to an empty car before you release gas.
If you are in a busy office, head to an empty meeting room or common area and fart there so no one can be offended by the sound or smell.
You can mask the smell of your farts by spraying air freshener in the area or by using the scent of hand cream to ward off the smell.
Rub scented hand cream on your hands after you have farted so the scent overpowers any stinky smells that may be lingering in the air.
Do n't assume your girlfriend knows how you feel about her.
Be sure to tell her exactly how you feel.
Ambiguity leads to uncertainty, and that can put a strain on your relationship.
You are her confidant, so be sure to listen to everything she has to say.
Help her unwind by talking through any problems she had.
Empathize with her, share her highs and lows.
This will help bond you together.
The importance of listening in a relationship can not be stressed enough.
Even if what she is saying is boring to you, pay attention because it is n't boring to her.
Learn to listen "between the lines" and infer what you can do to help her.
Listening shows that you are invested in her life, and will build her trust , Beyond just listening, react to what she says
Become involved in the conversation, but do n't take it over.
Always be sincere, because it will be obvious when you're not being truthful.
Let her know that she's especially vibrant today.
When she changes her hairstyle, praise the new look.
Compliment her on something that she did in class / at work.
Make a positive comment about the clothes she is wearing.
If you do n't trust your girlfriend, she's not going to trust you back.
Every good relationship is based on a solid foundation of trust.
If she's going out with friends, do n't call or text her every twenty minutes.
Avoid jealousy.
Let her talk to other guys without your jumping in the conversation and getting defensive.
Just because you are dating does n't mean she can only talk to you.
Always treat her with the utmost respect, even when you're fighting.
Be respectful to her even when she's not around.
Do n't trash talk her behind her back.
Bring up any concerns directly with her.
Do n't stew on issues you have, be upfront and direct.
Do n't assume that she needs help with everything.
Do n't shoot down all her ideas.
A relationship is an equal partnership.
Never resort to name - calling or physical abuse.
Regular throat lozenges do n't do much to heal your throat, but they do alleviate the pain.
The extra saliva you produce with the candy in your mouth will lubricate the throat to relieve the itchy feeling.
Meanwhile, the medication in the drop acts as a local anesthetic which numbs the irritation in the throat.
Benadryl, Zyrtec, and Claritin are just a few brands of cold and flu antihistamines that are designed to soothe scratchy and sore throats.
Side effects of antihistamines may include dry mouth, dizziness, and headaches.
Plain old pain relievers, also called analgesics, like aspirin and Ibuprofen can also help to relieve the pain associated with an itchy throat.
Follow the directions on the packaging for correct dosage.
Keep in mind that aspirin should never be given to children or teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu - like symptom, as it can lead to the rare but fatal Reye's syndrome.
Throat spray is a great way of relieving itchy throats and dry, tickling coughs.
They usually contain phenol (or a similar ingredient) which numbs the throat.
Throat sprays are available over-the-counter in most pharmacies and are relatively cheap.
Some throat sprays even come in different flavors, like mint or berry flavor.
Gargling with a mouthwash that contains menthol (such as Listerine) a couple of times per day helps to numb the throat, alleviating the irritating, itchy feeling.
A itchy or sore throat may also signal a bacterial or viral infection that requires a doctor's attention, like strep throat, tonsillitis, or the flu.

This is the single most effective and easiest solution to increasing gas efficiency.
The most fuel - efficient speed may be the point at which your vehicle shifts to high gear.
For most vehicles, this is somewhere around 50 mph (80 km / h).
Your efficiency decreases significantly the faster you go.
You can avoid wasting fuel by not tailgating.
In these instances, you'll often be pressing the gas to regain the speed lost from braking which forces you to correct your following distance by applying your brakes, causing a vicious cycle.
This constant up and down uses up more fuel than just driving steadily and at a safe distance.
Repeated braking simply wastes energy, converting it into unnecessary heat energy and greatly reduces the service life of your brakes.
In the future most cars may be equipped with systems in which braking power will be converted into reusable energy, but it is highly unlikely that your car has this technology now unless it is a hybrid.
Every time you punch the gas to quickly accelerate after stopping you are burning extra fuel and increasing tire wear.
By accelerating more slowly you are only using the fuel required to get the vehicle to the cruising speed.
In short, you want to use the gas and brake pedals as little as possible.
Keeping that in mind while driving will keep your gas usage to a minimum.
Fuel consumption increases when you allow the vehicle speed to drift lower and then compensate by accelerating back up.
Maintaining a steady position on the accelerator keeps the gas flowing minimally.
Allowing the car to lose speed going up hills and gain speed going down increases efficiency.
And as for weaving, do n't do it.
It's for much the same reason – when you weave in and out of lanes, you're constantly speeding up and slowing down.
Relax and stick to one lane.
Another way to keep your foot off the brakes and the gas pedal is to use overdrive and cruise control on the highway.
Overdrive keeps your engine's speed down, extending the life of your engine, too.
Cruise control keeps your car going at a steady rate, allowing the gas a break from pumping too hard or not pumping enough.
However, it's only useful in stretches – do n't bother using it in town, you'll be stopping and starting too much for it to make any difference.
Higher gears at low speed and vice versa will lead to lose of more fuel.
Shift gears carefully and according to the desired speed.
This will cause less strain on your engine.
This is one of the oldest natural remedies for home plaque removal.
Simply shake a small amount of baking soda into a bowl, wet your toothbrush, then dip the bristles into the baking soda to coat.
Brush your teeth as normal.
If you like, you can also mix a pinch of salt into the baking powder.
Avoid brushing with pressure when you use baking soda as toothpaste.
Also, do not use baking soda for more than five days in a row because it is abrasive and may damage your tooth enamel if you use it too often.
Eating an apple or some melon directly after a meal will help to clean your teeth naturally and prevent plaque from building up on the surface of your teeth.
This will also help to keep gums healthy and prevent them from bleeding.
The vitamin C in citrus fruits such as oranges may help to prevent microorganisms from growing on the surface of teeth.
Try rubbing the rind of the orange over the surface of your teeth before going to sleep at night.
Chew a spoonful of sesame seeds, but do not swallow , Then use a dry toothbrush to brush your teeth, using the sesame seeds as a kind of toothpaste
They will help to remove plaque and polish your teeth at the same time.
Tomatoes and strawberries, like oranges, are rich in vitamin C. Cut them open and rub the juice on the surface of the teeth, leaving it to sit for about five minutes.
Do not use strawberries or tomatoes or apples or oranges or any other plaque removing foods if you're allergic to them.
Rinse out your mouth with a solution of baking soda dissolved in water.
If you prefer to stay away from the array of chemicals found in most store - bought toothpastes, it is possible to make your own plaque - busting natural version, using just a few simple ingredients.
Combine 1/2 cup of coconut oil with 2 to 3 tablespoons of baking soda, 2 little packets of stevia powder and 20 drops of your chosen essential oil, such as peppermint or cinnamon.
Store your homemade toothpaste in a small glass jar and use just like regular toothpaste.
Look for symbols that are n't numbers.
Think of variables as "unknown" numbers.
Cough loudly or make a loud noise.
Walk as you fart.
Leave the room or area.
Spray air freshener.
Develop good habits.
Do not procrastinate.
Keep a journal.
Seek support.
While figuring out what you want to do each day might sound relatively straightforward, this could actually be the most difficult and essential step in learning how to keep a daily schedule.
It's not always easy to figure out your goals and to achieve them.
At the same time, what you want to do in the moment may not align with your long - term goals.
It's best to balance these out as much as possible, as opposed to only focusing on one or the other.
Do you have a particular job or career you'd like to pursue?
Are there certain people you know who you'd like to become better friends with?
Maybe you want to make a sports team at your school.
Whatever your goals might be, getting them down on paper can make them seem more concrete than if they remain mere images inside your own head.
Make a list of incremental things you can do to start achieving these goals.
Plan time every day to do these activities.
It is useful to get advice from others when figuring out your goals.
But it's important to recognize the goals that are actually relevant to your own desires.
Your daily schedule may still have obligations that are n't aligned with your own goals.
For example, does your parent want you to become something specific, like a lawyer or a doctor?
While such wishes are often associated with parents' desires for their children to be happy and successful, this career path may not make the child happy and fulfilled.
Talking to them about how their desires for you might stifle your independence can be a good first step to becoming more comfortable figuring these things out for yourself.
The worst thing you can do is go through life doing what others want you to do and never figuring out what will truly make you happy.
When you determine your own long - term goals, figure out how these fit with the expectations that other people have for you.
You may not be able to completely avoid your obligations and other people's expectations.
But you can start to schedule your time to focus more diligently on your own goals.
Other tasks can wait.
As you strategize the flow of your daily schedule, block off time for the most immediate tasks.
You may have some tasks that are the same every day, while other tasks are a one - time occurrence.
You may need to adjust your schedule to accommodate one - time activities.
Mark a block of time every day as "flexible" time.
This can be used to take care of unforeseen tasks.
If you do n't have a task for the day, you can use it to make progress on a personal long - term goal, such as hitting the gym or practicing the guitar.
Be the center of attention.
Treat others well.
Stay active during class.
Establish your space.
Have fun.
Think about what she might like.

Ask a friend to look at the skin behind your ear.
Look at your eye color.
Apply filters to your photos.
Use the apps on your phone to make photos appealing and special.
Your skin should be clean and free of makeup, lotion, or toner.
Your skin needs to rest for about 15 minutes before proceeding, as your skin may appear pink from scrubbing and make it difficult to see your true undertone.
Different lightbulbs can affect your skin differently - they may give it a yellow or green cast, and interfere with the appearance of your skin tone.
Choosing a sunny spot to look for your undertones will prevent you from misjudging your undertones.
Try sitting next to a window.
If you have an outdoor seating area, go outside.
This is a quick way to determine your undertones if your veins are visible.
Hold up your arm in the natural light and determine the predominant color.
If you ca n't tell if your veins are green or blue, you may have a neutral skin tone.
If you have an olive complexion, you likely fall into this category.
If your veins appear green, you have a warm skin tone.
If your veins appear blue or purple, you have a cool skin tone.
Do you tan easily?
Do you burn or get freckles?
The amount of melanin in your skin determines how it reacts to sun exposure and can help you determine your skin tone.
If you tan easily and rarely burn, you have more melanin and you likely have a warm or neutral skin tone.
If your skin burns and does n't tan, you have less melanin and therefore a cooler skin tone.
Some women with very dark, ebony skin may not burn easily but still have a cool skin tone.
Try a few more tests to figure out your undertone.
Looking in a mirror, try to see how your skin looks in contrast to the white paper.
It may appear to have a yellow cast, a blue - red or rosy cast, or it may not appear to be either, but a gray color instead.
If your skin appears yellowish or sallow beside the white paper, you have a warm skin tone.
If your skin appears pink, rosy, or blueish - red, then you have a cool skin tone.
If your skin appears gray, your skin probably has an olive complexion with a neutral undertone.
The green from your complexion and the yellowish undertone combines to create this effect.
You can experiment with neutral and warm tones, since you fall somewhere in between.
If you ca n't determine any cast of yellow, olive, or pink, you have a neutral skin tone.
Neutral tones can look good in foundations and colors on both ends of the cool / warm spectrum.
Note whether it makes your face look grayish or washed out, or if it enhances your skin.
Then try with a sheet of silver foil.
If the gold foil looks best, you have a warm skin tone.
If the reflection from the silver foil makes your skin glow, you have a cool skin tone.
If you do n't notice a difference (both silver and gold are flattering), then you likely have a neutral skin tone.
If you do n't have gold or silver foil, try laying gold and silver jewelry on your wrist, and notice which one is more flattering.
If you have acne, rosacea, or another condition that might mask your skin tone, you can have a friend look at the skin directly behind the shell of your ear, as this area is less likely to be affected.
Have them examine the skin right in the little crease behind your ear.
If your skin is yellowish, then your skin tone is warm.
If your skin is pink or rosy, then your skin tone is cool If they have difficulty, they can try holding a white piece of paper near the skin.
That should help them see if it appears yellow or pink.
Your eye color can be a key to your undertones.
Lighter eyes like blue and pale brown usually mean you have cool undertones, while gold flecks usually indicate warm undertones.
For example, ice blue eyes usually mean you have cool skin, while honey brown eyes usually mean you have warm skin.
Look at how values for your chosen currency pairs have fluctuated over time.
Currency exchange rates are quoted in pairs of currency.
The exchange quote tells you how many units of currency will receive based on the currency you want to sell.
For example, a USD / EUR quote of .91 means that you'll receive 0.91 euros for every US dollar you sell.
The value of currencies frequently fluctuates.
Anything from political instability to a natural disaster may cause a fluctuation.
Make sure you understand that ratios between currencies are constantly changing.
To make a profit on your transaction, aim to buy currency that you expect will increase in value (base currency) using currency that you expect to decrease in value (quote currency).
For example, if you think that Currency A, which is currently $1.50, will increase, you could purchase a "call contract" for a certain amount of that currency.
If its value increases to $1.75, you have made money.
Assess the likelihood of big changes in currency values.
The better that a country is doing economically, the more likely it is that its currency will remain stable or increase in value relative to other counties.
Factors like interest rates, inflation rates, public debt, and political stability can all affect the value of a currency.
Changes in economic factors like the country's Consumer Price Index and Purchasing Managers Index can indicate that a currency's value is about to change , For even more information, see Trade Forex
Buying and selling foreign currency is a fraught prospect, even for expert investors.
Many investors use leverage, the practice of borrowing money to help them buy more currency.
For example, if you wanted to trade $10,000 of currency, you would probably borrow at a leverage rate of 200:1.
You could deposit as little as $100 into your margin account.
However, if a trade goes sour, you may end up not only losing your own money but owing your broker a great deal more than you might on stock or futures trades.
Additionally, it can be difficult to manage how much currency to trade at any one time and when to do so.
Prices of currency rise and fall rapidly, sometimes within hours.
For example, during one 24 - hour period in 2011, the US dollar dropped 4% to a record low against the Japanese yen and then rose 7.5%.
Websites like FXCM allow you to make mock investments in currency and practice trading the currencies with virtual money.
Wait to trade on the actual market until you have consistently made a profit on your demo account.

Make sure you have lots of room and that you do n't feel you're going to roll off the couch.
Prop up your back and neck with a pillow or two if it makes you feel more comfortable.
Avoid lying flat on your back if you are pregnant and past the first trimester.
Your uterus can put too much pressure on a central artery, actually suppressing blood flow, which is the opposite of what you want to do.
Place a couple of pillows behind your back so you are propped up at a 45 - degree angle.
Place pillows underneath your feet and ankles to elevate them.
Stack as many as necessary to elevate your feet to the level of your heart.
Raising your feet to heart level will help drain pooled blood from your feet and make it easier for your heart to increase circulation.
You may be most comfortable putting a pillow or two underneath your calves as well to support your elevated feet.
Regular 20 minute intervals of elevation should reduce the swelling.
You can use this opportunity to catch up on email, watch a movie, or accomplish other tasks that do n't require you to stand.
If you have an injury, such as a sprained ankle, you'll want to elevate your foot more often.
If you find that your foot swelling does n't go down by using this routine for a few days, you should make an appointment with your doctor.
Use an ottoman or footstool to lift your feet off the ground whenever possible while seated.
Raising your feet will increase blood circulation.
You can purchase a small footstool for under your desk if you spend lots of time sitting at work.
Use an ice pack wrapped in a tea towel to ice your elevated feet for up to ten minutes at a time.
Wait an hour between ice applications.
Doing this can reduce swelling further and ease any discomfort you're experiencing.
Always use a barrier between the ice and your bare skin.
If you're feeling the need to ice your feet more frequently due to swelling and pain, make an appointment with your doctor.
Mercantilism is a somewhat amorphous constellation of ideas specifying how the components of society should be organized.
Mercantilist writers did n't always agree with each other and were, ironically, often critical of the mercantilist system.
Still, a few central themes emerged: Protectionist measures should be implemented to protect domestic producers; exports should be increased and imports reduced; employment should be fostered in the domestic market; and monetary policy should increase the quantity of money and precious metals.
With regard to this last point, while consumable goods increase our quality of life, mercantilists believed that money was better than goods because money could always buy more goods, while goods might go unsold or even spoil.
Plus, they reasoned, goods are consumed and, therefore, "lost," while precious metals have lasting value.
Foreign business leaders re-emphasised their concerns on Thursday at the twice - yearly Vietnam Business Forum, held by the World Bank and Vietnam's Ministry of Planning and Investment.
Li cites high public approval of China's general direction as evidence that the Chinese prefer the political status quo.
In a country without free speech, however, asking people to directly evaluate their leaders' performance is a bit like giving a single - choice exam.
According to 2003 surveys cited in How East Asians View Democracy, edited by the researchers Yun - han Chu, Larry Diamond, Andrew Nathan, and Doh Chull Shin, 72.3 percent of the Chinese public polled said they believed that democracy is "desirable for our country now," and 67 percent said that democracy is "suitable for our country now.", These two numbers track with those recorded for well - established East Asian democracies, including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan
Since 1990, according to a report briefly posted a few months ago on the Web site of China's central bank, corrupt Chinese officials - about 18,000 of them - have collectively funneled some $120 billion out of the country.
That figure is equivalent to China's entire education budget between 1978 and 1998.
Beyond the sheer financial loss, corruption has also led to extremely poor food - safety records, since officials are paid to not enforce regulations.
A 2007 Asian Development Bank report estimated that 300 million people in China suffer from food - borne diseases every year.
Food safety is not the only woe.
Corruption leads to bridge and building collapses that kill and chemical factory spills that poison China's environment - and their cover - ups.
For many of us, that is a welcome conclusion.
It may also seem to be an obvious one.
But Mr. Acemoglu pointed out that academics, policy makers and business leaders have often advanced quite different views.
One perspective is that all that matters is economic growth and the right technocratic mix of policies necessary to deliver it.
This approach, implicit in the prescriptions of so many International Monetary Fund missions, is that if countries can get richer, everything else will fall into place.
But there is a third category of experience - phenomena that are the product of human action but not of human design.
Hanoi's economic planners in recent weeks have flagged their intent to do more to combat their currency problem instead of focusing relentlessly on bolstering headline gross - domestic - product growth figures, as they have in past years.
Romney has stated he will label China a ‘ currency manipulator 'on his first day as president.
This is largely a rhetorical tool as it requires only the launch of negotiations with China.
While China is likely to react to this political statement, such a designation will have only limited practical impact.
The long - term extensive interactions of many in Romney's foreign - policy team with Chinese officials mean that the blowback will be managed to ensure no permanent or significant impact to the bilateral relationship.
Two factors make managing this rise particularly difficult.
The first is the lack of transparency in China mentioned earlier: inadequate understanding of Chinese interests and concerns can lead to misunderstandings and potential conflicts.
The second relates to the tension between showing consideration for China's interests and appearing, in Chinese eyes, to be weak.
But the real reason I make more than the average employee at Wal - Mart has nothing to do with the compassion of George Mason University compared to the greediness of Wal - Mart.
It has everything to do with my alternatives outside of George Mason compared to the alternatives of the average Wal - Mart employee, just as the price of my house depends on the prices of alternative houses of similar quality.
If we want the Wal - Marts of the world to pay higher wages, low - skill workers have to acquire more skills, more education, more higher - paying alternatives.
Many Americans may not realize that some of today's political leaders and mainstream media espouse ideas that were discredited and left for dead over two hundred years ago.
As in any number of horror flicks, sometimes the dead do n't stay that way.
The authors conclude with a prediction about Russia's future that fits neatly within their framework of extractive vs. inclusive institutions and labels Putin's Russia the former: "The Kremlin talks about creating the next China, but Russia's path is more likely to be something like that of Angola - an oil - dependent state that is growing now because of high oil prices but has floundered in the past when oil prices were low and whose leaders seem more intent on maintaining themselves in office to control oil revenues and other rents than on providing public goods and services to a beleaguered population."
"This is n't a sustainable way to run an economy," says Nguyen Quang A, an economist who ran Vietnam's only independent economic think tank until its founders opted to close it amid tightening government censorship.
The two writers strongly disagreed: "This conventional narrative is wrong, based almost entirely on a spurious correlation between autocracy and growth.
The emergence of Russian democracy in the 1990s did indeed coincide with state breakdown and economic decline, but it did not cause either.
The reemergence of Russian autocracy under Putin, conversely, has coincided with economic growth but not caused it (high oil prices and recovery from the transition away from communism deserve most of the credit). "
Sendek says the practice is not only ineffective, it can also teach children that hitting is acceptable.
Sendek, who has worked in with abused and neglected children for three decades, says children who are hit ultimately learn to avoid the punisher, not the behavior.
She cited a number of instances in which children were seriously injured and asked why so many American children are subject to this type of punishment.
Democratize or Die: Why China's Communists Face Reform or Revolution
The second area is in cyber and space security.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has recently expressed American willingness to engage more actively in building an international code of conduct for outer space.
The administration is also likely to work with other interested countries to engage the Chinese government on standards to limit the hacking and espionage emanating from China.
As Adam Smith pointed out,
It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy....
If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage .7
Protecting domestic industries has a certain appeal.
By keeping out foreign competitors, the thinking goes, we can save jobs for Americans and give struggling industries the shelter they need to become strong.
First, there is the effort put into lobbying Congress instead of making tough choices and creating a productive industry.
Second is the direct cost of the protected jobs.
For example, to save 226 American luggage manufacturing jobs, American consumers have been forced to pay an additional $290 million annually for their luggage, which translates to an outrageous $1.285 million for each job saved .8 (No one, especially the American consumer, would argue that those jobs are worth that much.)
One is just as arbitrary as the other.
Indeed, most of us have heard of the friend ("the consumer") buying a car from another friend ("the producer") who leans on the friendship to ask for a lower price.
But the engineering way of thinking does n't work with emergent phenomena.
Trying to change emergent results is inherently more complex than building a bridge or expanding your kitchen or even putting a man on the moon.
Understanding the challenge involved is to begin to answer the old question that asks why we can put a man on the moon but we ca n't eliminate poverty.
In such a setting, money alone - in the amounts that a non-economic approach might suggest, one that ignores the impact of incentives and markets - is unlikely to be successful.
When I studied economics in college, I learned that mercantilism supplanted feudalism to become the predominant economic doctrine through the late Middle Ages.
Mercantilism, "economic nationalism for the purpose of building a wealthy and powerful state," 1 is based on this logic: "The richer the nation, the stronger the nation; the stronger the nation, the better for every member of that kingdom. , 2 It was n't until the 17th century that mercantilism was seriously challenged, and Adam Smith finally drove a stake through its heart when he published The Wealth of Nations 235 years ago
Perhaps most economists hold this clean view of history, but it seems that the rest of the world never got the memo.
Unfortunately, the archaic and counterproductive ideas of mercantilism are alive and kicking in 21st - century America.
Moody's Investors Service signaled the extent of the problems Wednesday, downgrading its rating on Vietnamese government debt to B1 from Ba3 in part because of the downward pressure on Vietnam's currency and worsening inflation.
It also maintained a negative outlook on the country's ratings, citing the mounting debt problems at state - run Vietnam Shipbuilding Industry Group as another reason for the downgrade.
Both Romney and Obama are likely to continue the rebalancing of America's strategic focus towards Asia , this does not necessarily indicate a distancing from Europe
However, the level of US forces in Europe is likely to be affected more by Obama's intended defence cuts in a second term than they would be under Romney, given the latter's intention to maintain or even increase defence spending.
The international community has stepped up reform calls in the weeks before the congress, hoping they would be heard by the top leaders, he said.
Vietnam's currency woes serve as a reminder that not all emerging markets are the same at a time when investors are pouring money into frontier economies worldwide.
Other obstacles include endemic corruption and the instability of the Vietnamese currency, the dong, which has been devalued three times since late last year.
"Investors wonder which over-extended state - owned conglomerate will be the next to fail, or which will be forced into taking bad assets onto their balance sheets," he has said.
While I have nothing against gold and silver (I own some of each), they are a store of value - a means to an end - not an end in themselves.
I hope to use my gold and silver (and dollars, yen, renminbi, and euros) to someday buy another house, another car, more education, and more vacations.
It is these goods and services - not the intermediate stores of value that I use to purchase them - that improve and enrich my life.
By focusing on stockpiling money and structurally impeding the market in the process, mercantilist actions ensure that I will get fewer of the goods and services I want.
Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has ordered government ministries to set prices on goods such as coal and petrol to keep price rises in check.
Among his tools, so far unused, are new rules enabling the government to impose price controls on goods and services produced by foreign and private companies in addition to those of state - owned enterprises.
It's easy to divide the world we experience into these two types of phenomena - things like the temperature in your house that are the result of human activity and human intention and things like the rain outside that are not the result of human activity or human intention.
The figure rises to 120 billion dollars if energy infrastructure in the power - short nation is included, it said.
Understanding the emergent phenomena economists call a market is the essence of the economic way of thinking.
In contrast, the human brain seems more accustomed to what might be called the engineering way of thinking where human action and human design work together.
If I'm dissatisfied with the size of my kitchen, I make a plan and by following the plan, if it's a good plan, the result is a bigger kitchen.
A person who sits around hoping for a new kitchen without design or action is going to be disappointed.
Or if I notice the leaves falling from the trees, I do n't hope that they're going to clean themselves up.
I have to plan to rake them and then do the actual raking.
Changing my thermostat to alter the temperature inside my house is another such example.
But Mr. Acemoglu and Mr. Robinson believe that dignity and long - term prosperity are intimately connected.
The protesters, who put the demand for political rights ahead of everything else, are right; the academic consensus that argues they should simply focus on the correct economic policies is wrong.
That orderliness, that predictability, runs through our lives in ways we rarely appreciate.
Ironically, we do n't have a vocabulary to describe this peculiar form of group influence.
There's no vote and no delegation of power to experts or a committee by the group.
The speakers of English "decide" which words live and die but not in the way we usually mean the word "decide" which implies a conscious decision.
There is no group consciousness.
Consider the average employee at Wal - Mart who earns less than the average and has no health care benefits.
If the seller does n't set the price of the house why do people blame Wal - Mart for paying low wages or offering inadequate health care benefits?
It seems obvious that Wal - Mart sets its wages, but that is as naïve is thinking that the seller of the house determines its price.
"Corporal punishment does n't get us the results we want," said Deborah Sendek, program director of the Center for Effective Discipline, a group that advocates against corporal punishment.
"You can get the same result from an intervention – simply telling and teaching children to stop the behavior."
Last month, the central bank pushed up its benchmark lending rate to 9% from 8% to help support the dong and contain prices, while the government has slapped a 10% tax on gold exports to help sustain the supply of the metal and avert any potential panic.
The chairman of AmCham also told the forum that Vietnam has violated its World Trade Organization commitments with a new price control law targeting overseas firms.
It is unclear whether the current policies are enough to stop the rot.
In a research note to clients this month, Capital Economics asked whether Vietnam is heading for a crisis in 2011.
Vinashin officials did n't respond to requests for comment.
A Credit Suisse spokesman said the investment bank had no comment.
If I buy a made - in - Japan car from Toyota, what happens?
I get a nice car and a Japanese company gets some dollars that it then pays to its suppliers, employees, and shareholders (the last of whom include me).
What can these people do with the dollars that they do n't spend on American goods?
Only five things: buy U.S. assets, including stocks, bonds, and land; engage in direct investment in the United States by building plants, etc.; buy U.S. services; exchange the dollars on the currency market; or keep them.
Economists say the country has also used up much of its foreign reserves supporting the dong.
Vietnam keeps the precise level of its foreign reserves secret, but the International Monetary Fund recently estimated it had enough to provide for 1.8 months of imports - a dangerously slim amount and well short of the three months that multilateral agencies consider adequate.
They urged infrastructure development, upgrading workers' skills, streamlining bureaucracy and other reforms.
"However, the country is struggling to live up to its full potential, hindered by slow progress on a list of perennial barriers to investment."
The dong has already lost about one - fifth of its value against the U.S. dollar since mid-2008, and black - market rates for dollars are currently 10% or more above the official exchange rate.
That is fueling speculation that the government will be forced to devalue the dong again in the next few months to bring official values closer in line with street rates.
Who invented the verb "to google? , Or the nouns" cyberspace "or" blog?
Because no one is in charge, we might expect language to be chaotic and random.
But words do n't fall like rain.
Which words live and which words die, which words delight the mind and which words get ignored, is n't a random phenomenon.
Human beings and their choices make these words (and not others) part of the English language because they are useful.
But not in the usual sense that we use the word "we," the sense of a collective decision.
There is no collective decision, merely the result of a sufficient number of individuals using particular words that spread by word of mouth.
Language emerges from the complex interaction of those who speak, read and write it.
The gold and jewelry stores along Ho Chi Minh City's Le Loi Street are doing a roaring trade most mornings, selling everything from U.S. dollars to South Korean won to residents desperate to unload their dong.
The biggest trades often are made by vendors who also hawk goods like shirts, shoes and dried mangoes at the cavernous Ben Thanh market nearby.
On a recent Tuesday, Nguyen Thi Phuong placed several bricks of Vietnamese dong on the glass table at Thuy Van's kiosk and asked how much to convert it into gold.
The answer: 36.7 million dong per tael, or $1,447 per ounce, about 2.3% higher than international prices that day.
But reality is not optional.
You can not have a sudden reduction is gasoline available to the market and low prices at the same time.
There is no dial for gasoline prices.
The boy was spanked for roughhousing with another student on a school bus.
Jones said her son had welts on his buttocks, missed a week of school and still has nightmares about the incident.
It would be tempting to answer that question with a similar question - what right does the seller of houses in Washington, DC have to exploit the prospective buyer by charging a higher price than people pay in St. Louis.
But that answer misses two deeper points.
The first is that Wal - Mart is n't exploiting people by hiring them.
In fact, the opposite is the case.
By creating a business model that allows low - skill workers to serve customers hungry for low - price goods, Wal - Mart increases the alternatives available to low - skill workers and raises their wages above what they would otherwise receive in a world without Wal - Mart.
Meanwhile, unlike many Asian countries, Vietnam runs a substantial trade deficit, which adds further downward pressure on the dong.
Officials here expect a deficit of $12 billion this year, little changed from 2009.

A gathering as opaque as it is fundamental, the Congress will determine key political posts for the next five years, as well as the country's main "economic themes", said Benoit de Treglode, director of the Research Institute on Contemporary Southeast Asia (IRASEC) in Bangkok.
If Hanoi's policy makers act decisively by tightening monetary policy, analysts said, they could restore confidence in Vietnam and its financial markets and gradually revive the flagging dong.
Alternatively, finding ways to cooperate with China could induce it to accelerate the pace of liberalization of its capital account, allowing greater flexibility of the renminbi's exchange rate as well as deeper reforms in its domestic financial sector.
The likely consequence would be increasing capital outflow from China to invest in the rest of the world, but more profoundly, greater opportunities and easier market accessibility for international capital to invest inside the Chinese market.
Vietnam has always introduced reforms at its own pace -- slowly and carefully.
While we are focused on the November elections in the US, Chinese politics are also in a state of flux, with an anticipated retirement of seven of the nine members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Communist Party at the end of this year.
Recent political turbulence around the purging of Politburo member and Chongqing party boss, Bo Xilai, in early April has increased sensitivity to additional internal or external political pressure.
The point, Mr. Acemoglu argues, is that wealth in and of itself does n't lead to sustained growth: "Saudi Arabia can get a lot of growth, but that is not the right growth.
Take away the oil and Saudi Arabia would be like a poor African country. "
It is unfortunate that well - meaning people often join in concert with self - interested competitors of Wal - Mart to hamper Wal - Mart and other employers from expanding.
It is tragic when a lack of economic understanding pushes a nation to the edge of economic chaos.
HANOI - Celebrated as a new "Asian Tiger" two decades ago, Vietnam has lagged behind its neighbours and needs further reforms in order to catch up, foreign investors say.

This essay is adapted from a book in progress on the role of emergent phenomena in creating our standard of living.
To take one very important example, the orderliness of prices and the resulting lack of shortages allows knowledge to be widely dispersed via specialization.
Such specialization sustains our standard of living.
The level of specialization emerges alongside the prices, but the prices make it all possible.
A pencil company never worries about there being a graphite shortage or a cedar shortage or a shortage of yellow lacquer.
That lets the pencil factory outsource these materials and avoid the accumulation of knowledge necessary to master all of the processes involved in pencil making.
The emergence of prices allows a world to emerge where no one knows how to make a pencil.
That world is a pleasant one because it is a world where pencils are inexpensive, abundant and always available.

Officials at Vietnam Shipbuilding Industry Group, or Vinashin, also are scrambling to reschedule some of its $4.4 billion in debt after the company almost collapsed during the summer.
Several top executives have been arrested for allegedly masking the extent of the firm's problems, and new government - appointed managers have told creditors that the shipbuilder might not be able to make a $60 million initial repayment on a $600 million syndicated loan arranged by Credit Suisse in 2007 - a failure that could badly tarnish the country's international reputation.
Since 1989, the CCP has not adopted any genuine political reforms, relying on high growth rates to maintain its rule.
This strategy can work only when the economy is booming - something Beijing can not take for granted.
It matters tremendously whether the CCP proactively adopts political reforms or is forced to do so in reaction to a catastrophic crisis.
It would be far better for the political system to change gradually and in a controlled manner, rather than through a violent revolution.
The CCP could regain its prestige by reclaiming the mandate of reform, and it could improve China's political system without having to surrender its power.
Not many autocratic regimes get this kind of an opportunity; the CCP should not squander it.
"Can you imagine anyone celebrating a decline in the value of his or her assets?"
"It is really about societies that have a more equitable distribution of political power versus those that do n't," Mr. Acemoglu told me.
"It is about societies where the elite, the rich, can do what they want and those where they can not."
The Reality of Markets
Their one - word answer, as Mr. Acemoglu summed it up for me, is "politics."
Mr. Acemoglu and Mr. Robinson divide the world into countries governed by "inclusive" institutions and those ruled by "extractive" ones.
Inclusive societies, with England and its Glorious Revolution of 1688 in the vanguard, deliver sustainable growth and technological innovation.
Extractive ones can have spurts of prosperity, but because they are ruled by a narrow elite guided by its own self - interest, their economic vigor eventually fades.
My income, for example, is higher than the average Wal - Mart employee , That might fool you into thinking that my employer, George Mason is compassionate while greedy Wal - Mart only cares about the bottom line
Today, as China looks to the medium term, the government must face the problems created by its pervasive role in the economy.
A new World Bank report singles out lack of reform of state - owned enterprises as the most important impediment to the country's economic growth.
But that is only a symptom of a deeper problem: the government's dominant role in economic affairs.
We have no trouble wrapping our minds around the concept that no one individual is in charge of how long it takes to get from here to there during rush hour in a major American city.
No one would argue that just because I drove the car and it took an extra half hour for my trip during rush hour that it was my intention that the trip would take that long.
Even though I drove the car, even though I was at the wheel, we all understand that it was n't my intention to take an extra half hour.
We understand that the extra half hour was due to the individual choices of all the other drivers.
We also understand that it would be absurd to suggest that "we," all of the drivers combined, have a collective intention that the drive at rush hour takes longer than outside of rush hour.
It's no individual's intention , And it is n't the result of a collective intention, either
Why does it take so long to get around during rush hour?
But it's not a random or a natural phenomenon.
Traffic is the result of human activity but not the result of human design.
The time it takes to get from here to there emerges from the complex interaction of the decisions made by those who drive.
It has a predictability despite the fact that no one is intending it to be that way.
Traffic is slower in rush hour than during the middle of the day.
Traffic is slower in big cities relative to small ones.
China has long been considered a ‘ black box 'for the United States.
Relations between the two countries have been characterized by strategic mistrust and uncertainty.
From the American side, China's rise is both an opportunity and a threat.
Policy - making in Washington is complicated by the lack of clarity over the balance of power between China's civilian government and its military, and their respective interests and objectives.
From the Chinese perspective there is also uncertainty regarding America's intent and whether it is really trying to hedge or contain.
In addition to controlling 25 - 30% of GDP directly, the government also takes a lion's share of financial resources.
In recent years, more than one - third of total bank lending has gone to infrastructure, most of which has been built by government entities.
Indeed, recognizing its over-investment in infrastructure, the government recently abandoned several high - speed rail projects that were already under construction.
But government over-investment is also evident in numerous industrial parks and high - tech zones.
Opponents of the ban say spanking is matter of tradition and good old - fashioned discipline.

Other mercantilist actions available to the U.S. government include import restrictions and tariffs, which various politicians and pundits discuss and advocate regularly.
Similarly, if you move from St. Louis to Washington D.C. as I did two years ago, you'll find that a house in Washington D.C. is more expensive than a comparable house in St. Louis.
When I bought my house in Washington, I was n't angry at the seller for charging such a high price.
I did n't blame him for the price discrepancy between his house and a similar one in St. Louis.
I did n't express outrage that he was charging almost ten times what he had paid for the house when it was new in 1969.
Most people understand that the price of a house is n't really set in any real sense by the seller or by any one person or by any collective will.
No one intended that the price of housing in Washington DC double over the past five years as it has.
The answer, said economist Kevin Grice, is "yes" unless Vietnam moves more aggressively to let interest rates rise further and does more to tackle state - enterprise spending that, while encouraging growth, also contributes to a large budget deficit.
Two aspects of the Chinese economy presage a path to democratization.
One is the level of per capita GDP.
China has already crossed what some social scientists believe to be the threshold beyond which most societies inevitably begin to democratize - between $4,000 and $6,000.
As the China scholar Minxin Pei has pointed out, of the 25 countries with higher per capita GDPs than China that are not free or partially free, 21 of them are sustained by natural resources.
Other than this exceptional category, countries become democratic as they get richer.
There are two areas where more attention is likely in the coming years.
The first relates to China's engagement in international regimes, not least the WTO and G20.
Given Obama's more multilateral stance than his predecessor's, it is likely that his administration will continue to try to engage the Chinese government in these arenas, where possible cultivating their support for broad international norms on issues such as North Korea, Burma / Myanmar and Syria.
The Obama team is also likely to continue encouraging other partners, particularly in Europe, to expand their perspectives on China, taking into consideration broader strategic and security issues rather than focusing almost exclusively on commercial engagement.
The US Election Note series is made possible through the support of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation.
While the ‘ pivot 'to Asia will continue, efforts to ensure it is not perceived as directed against China will be maintained.
While a downturn in US - Chinese relations could have an economic impact on other Asia - Pacific countries, these would also be concerned about the security implications.
Rising tensions between the two countries makes balancing between them harder.
If the United States were perceived to be the instigator of such elevated tensions, a pull - back from America could occur in the region (a reverse of what has happened in recent years following China's aggressive posturing).
In its six - decade rule, the CCP has tried everything from land collectivization to the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution to privatization.
According to Li, that makes the CCP "one of the most self - reforming political organizations in recent world history.", Unfortunately, China's prime minister does not have Li's confidence that Beijing has learned from the disasters of its past and can correct its mistakes
Last March, in response to myriad corruption and political scandals, Wen warned that without political reforms, "such historical tragedies as the Cultural Revolution may happen again."
The return on education is increasing in China, but access to education is becoming increasingly divided socially and geographically.
While education is improving in urban areas, children in the countryside are facing a decline in educational quality, because better teachers find their way to the cities.
Moreover, given the income disparities between cities and rural areas, their education is more expensive than it is for urban families.
Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam - At a time when many emerging markets are trying to stem a destabilizing rise in their local currencies against the dollar, up - and - coming Vietnam is grappling with a rather different problem: Residents ca n't get enough of the U.S. greenback, as their own currency, the dong, threatens to spiral lower.
But Mr. Acemoglu and Mr. Robinson argue that if an extractive regime is in charge, neither wealth nor private property can save a country from eventual decline.
The Russia of today, they believe, is a textbook extractive regime, and that is what makes the vote this weekend, and the unexpected protests that preceded it, so significant.
Mercantilists argued for a strong nation with a strong military.
With the importation of manufactured goods, some fear an atrophy of America's manufacturing ability, and so it is the (largely mercantilist) hawks who offer the only modern argument for keeping domestic manufacturing strong at the expense of the rest of the economy.
They ask, "What happens if we go to war and we have no ability to manufacture tanks and guns? , 3 The simplest solution, of course, is to avoid starting any wars
(History shows that this is unlikely.)
The U.S. military is perennially muscle - bound and U.S. manufacturing is persistently strong.
While it is true that American manufacturing has shed seven million workers since the late 1970s, today's workers produce three times as much as their 1972 counterparts .4 U.S. manufacturing hit an all - time record for output in 20075 - before the recession - and is virtually tied with China for the world's largest.
Consider that if the U.S. manufacturing sector were a separate economy, it would fit nicely between France and the United Kingdom as the world's sixth - largest economy, enjoying an annual output of $2.155 trillion6 - hardly reason for hand - wringing.
One mercantilist action available to a country like the United States is to devalue its currency, which simultaneously makes its exports cheaper and its imports more expensive.
This may sound logical, but this tenet of mercantilism is counterproductive.
If you have dollars in your wallet and I have yen, would n't you be upset if your dollars became less valuable and you grew poorer relative to me?
Can you imagine anyone celebrating a decline in the value of his or her assets?
Traffic congestion is n't like the rain.
But the obvious ways, the ways that are akin to turning a dial do n't work the way people anticipate.
Widening the freeways and adding public transit options fail to reduce rush hour traffic for anything other than the very short term.
These "solutions" treat the outcomes of an emergent process as if they were the temperature on the thermostat.
They inevitably fail.
Vietnam Battles Dark Side of Boom
Despite officials' seeming desire to reduce income inequality, China's government is aggravating it, by – among other things – subsidizing producers, favoring capital - intensive industries, and maintaining a highly inefficient financial sector.
But there are also promising signs of an economic uptick.
The government has just announced new rules for household registration, known as hukou.
Except in large cities, people can now freely choose their hukou after three years of residency.
This will greatly help migrants by ensuring equal access to education for their children.
Some analysts, though, said it will be difficult for Vietnam to shake off its old ways.
Already, the government is projecting an inflation rate of at least 7% a year for the next five years, far higher than its neighbors, in a sign that it intends to pursue its target - driven, growth - at - all - costs policies.
Li contends that a person with the credentials of Barack Obama before he was elected U.S. president would not have gone far in Chinese politics.
He is right, but so is the flip side.
Consider Bo Xilai, the former member of the Politburo whose wife confessed to murder, who could mysteriously afford an expensive overseas education for his son on a public servant's salary, and who oversaw a red terror campaign against journalists and lawyers, torturing and throwing in jail an untold number of citizens without a modicum of due process.
No one with Bo's record would go very far in the United States.
In China, however, he excelled.
And before his downfall, he possessed the same unchecked power as Qiu, which he used to resurrect the very elements of the Cultural Revolution that Wen spoke out against.
Call it the dark side of Vietnam's economic boom.
In recent years, Vietnam has established itself as a major production hub for the global economy, luring big names such as Canon Inc. and Intel Corp. to its shores and racking up some of the fastest growth rates in Asia after China.
To be sure, there are many corrupt democracies.
As Li points out, Argentina, Indonesia, and the Philippines have terrible track records on that score.
But ruthless military dictators governed each of those countries for decades before they opened up.
Those autocracies created the corrupt systems with which the new democracies must contend.
Democracies should be taken to task for their failure to root out corruption, but no one should confuse the symptom with the cause.
Worldwide, there is no question that autocracies as a whole are far more corrupt than democracies.
As a 2004 Transparency International report revealed, the top three looting officials of the preceding two decades were Suharto, the ruler of Indonesia until 1998; Ferdinand Marcos, who led the Philippines until 1986; and Mobutu Sese Seko, president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo until 1997.
These three dictators pillaged a combined $50 billion from their impoverished people.
China does seem light years beyond both the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, which were disastrous for the country.
But the party has never explicitly repudiated or accepted culpability for either, nor has it dealt with the question of how to prevent similar catastrophes in the future.
In a system with no true accountability or checks and balances, Wen's worries - and those of hundreds of millions of Chinese who suffered through the horrors of those events - are sincere and justified.
BEIJING – If everything goes right for China, it will surpass the United States as the world's largest economy, in current dollar terms (and more quickly in real terms), by 2021.
Its per capita income will reach that of today's lower tier of high - income countries.
But, despite its forward momentum, the Chinese economy faces looming risks in the coming decade.
In the run - up to the elections, Chatham House will produce a series of Election Notes on major foreign policy issues, explaining the background, the relative positions of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney and the international implications of each.
These Election Notes will not just provide independent analysis of what the candidates say, but draw upon an understanding of their record in office, if relevant, and their domestic and foreign policy teams to provide a deeper and more rounded assessment of their likely approach to major foreign policy issues.
They are intended to inform and be relevant to governments, businesses, NGOs, foundations and the broader public.

The problem is not that China is lenient on corruption.
The government routinely executes complicit officials.
And some are high ranking, such as Cheng Kejie, who was vice chair of the National People's Congress before he was executed in 2000, and Zheng Xiaoyu, director of the State Food and Drug Administration, who was executed in 2007.
The problem is the absence of any checks and balances on their power and the lack of the best breaks on corruption of all, transparency and a free press.
Both potential administrations are likely to pay more attention in the coming years to the increasing concerns regarding security in the cyber and space domain.
These will be difficult fields in which to engage China, and both administrations are likely to bring in other partners through multilateral institutions.
Addressing these new areas of potential tension is vital not just for the United States and China but also for the broader international community.
You go back inside and grab a raincoat or an umbrella.
"All the authorities should take strong measures to control gold prices and stabilize the foreign - exchange rates and interest rates, and punish speculation in gold and foreign currencies," Mr. Dung said earlier this month.
While it has not been a central part of his campaign to date, Romney's private - sector background is likely to make him more sensitive to the hacking, IPR and espionage concerns of many in the US business community.
Working towards a more level playing field for foreign companies in China, and supporting US competitive advantage, will be a high priority for his administration.
Romney has stated that he will ensure that China stands by the same values and norms as other countries, particularly in the economic and trade sphere.
The second structural condition presaging democratization is that China's torrid growth will almost certainly slow down, heightening conflicts and making corruption a heavier burden to bear.
When the economy is growing, people are willing to put up with some graft.
When it is n't, the same level of corruption is intolerable.
If China continues with its political status quo, conflicts are likely to escalate sharply, and the pace of capital flight from the country, already on the rise due to declining confidence in China's economic and political future, will accelerate.
If not stemmed, the loss of confidence among economic elites will be extremely dangerous for the Chinese economy and could trigger substantial financial instabilities.
But you would never know that by listening to most politicians or by reading most newspapers.
Is n't it time to dispel anachronistic ideas and listen to the insightful masters of modern economics?
The current administration has worked with China on a broad range of issues, engaging in numerous dialogues from the Strategic and Economic Dialogue to more recently expanding the conversation on issues from Asia - Pacific cooperation to humanitarian assistance and disaster response.
A second term is likely to maintain the emphasis on engagement, focusing on areas of collaboration rather than those of concern, ranging from the economic to the environmental.
There is another problem with the story: for each Qiu, there are countless Chinese politicians who were promoted up through the CCP for less positive reasons.
Systematic data simply do not bear out Li's assertion that the Chinese political system as a whole is meritocratic.
In a rigorous analysis of economic and political data, the political scientists Victor Shih, Christopher Adolph, and Mingxing Liu found no evidence that Chinese officials with good economic track records were more likely to be promoted than those who performed poorly.
What matters most is patronage - what Wu Si, a prominent historian and editor in China, calls the "hidden rule" of the promotion system.
While Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich are still candidates for the Republican nomination, it is sufficiently unlikely that either will become the Republican nominee for them not to be included in this analysis.
"There is a third category of experience - phenomena that are the product of human action but not of human design."
Language is one example.
No one designs or controls the English language.
There are self - appointed experts who try and influence the way English evolves but they have no real control anymore than the French government can stop the French people from calling Saturday and Sunday "le weekend" rather than the government - approved "fin de semaine."
Researchers have found that spanking can increase aggressiveness in children and can even hurt the mental development of young children.
Some officials close to the regime admit the need for reform.
"An unwillingness to support a seemingly strategic company … raises questions on the health of the public enterprise sector at large, and the adequacy of official holdings of foreign - exchange reserves," Moody's said in a statement Wednesday.
You're sitting in your house and it seems unusually chilly for a hot summer day.
You adjust the dial to a more comfortable setting and go back to your reading.
But that is n't an issue for Vietnam.
Instead, residents are now hoarding dollars and other stores of value because they consider just about anything to be better than the dong.
The second point is that viewing Wal - Mart as the cause of low wages can lead to destructive policies like banning Wal - Mart from opening a store in your city.
When Wal - Mart opens a new store, workers eagerly line up for the opportunity to work there.
"When you think of somebody like Chávez, you will see that his objective is not to enrich Venezuela," Mr. Acemoglu said, referring to President Hugo Chávez.
"He is not letting markets work because his goal is something else."
China is the largest holder of US securities, making it sensitive to weaknesses in the dollar (although China has started to diversify its holdings).
China and the United States are each other's second - largest trading partners.
The significant bilateral trade imbalance between them, although decreasing, is a source of tension in the United States, as is the perceived, albeit diminishing, undervaluation of the renminbi.
Should Your Child Be Spanked at School?
The International Monetary Fund last week warned that Hanoi needs to tighten monetary policy and also do more to cut public debt.
"Further reforms are needed to safeguard a financial system that is robust, efficient and market - based," the IMF's Asian - Pacific chief, Masato Miyazaki, said in a statement.
NEW YORK - To understand the significance of the presidential election this weekend in Russia, read a book written by two U.S. - based academics and being published this month.
"Why Nations Fail," by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, respectively, is a wildly ambitious work that hopscotches through history and around the world to answer the very big question of why some countries get rich and others do n't.

There are calls for more democracy in China.
It is true that the party's antireform bloc has had the upper hand since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.
But recently, voices for reform within the CCP have been gaining strength, aided in large part by calls for honesty, transparency, and accountability from hundreds of millions of Internet - using Chinese citizens.
China's new leaders seem at least somewhat willing to adopt a more moderate tone than their predecessors, who issued strident warnings against "westernization" of the Chinese political system.
So far, what has held China back from democracy is not a lack of demand for it but a lack of supply.
It is possible that the gap will start to close over the next ten years.
Overloaded infrastructure, an under - qualified workforce, excessive bureaucracy and corruption are just some of the problems investors cite.
Thomas Sowell likes to say that reality is not optional.
But we oh so want it to be.
We want to change outcomes without consequences with the ease of adjusting the thermostat on the wall of our house.
We want to blame Wal - Mart for the fact that its employees earn below the national average.
We want to blame China (or Mexico or Japan or India) for our trade deficit.
We want to blame or honor the occupant of the White House for whether new jobs are high - paying or low - paying.
This worldview that flies in the face of reality and that ignores the inherent complexity of the real world is the bread - and - butter of journalism and the breeding ground for unintended consequences.
The dong has lost about one - fifth of its value against the U.S. dollar since mid-2008.
Above, an employee counts Vietnamese dong bank notes at a bank in Hanoi.
Mercantilism is an economic theory from the perspective of exporters, protectionists, politicians, and money hoarders, and its primary beneficiaries are big business and big government.
Basically, the more goods you sell outside your country and the more gold and silver you bring in and store safely in your vaults, the better.
The corollaries are that exports are good, imports are bad, a weak currency is wonderful, and trade surpluses are the bees' knees.
In addition to its growing military investment, the apparent division between China's generals and civilian government also raises concerns regarding who has ultimate authority and whether the military might take actions contrary to bilateral agreements between the United States and the Chinese government.
The weak links between the military and likely Chinese future leaders after the 18th Communist Party Congress later this year have increased concerns in the United States about what kind of player the Chinese military might be in the future, and whether it might be more aggressive.
Dignity and the Wealth of Nations
AmCham's Sitkoff regrets that the state sector continues to play a dominant role in the economy.
'That's child abuse to me,' the 32 - year old told reporters, 'If they do n't want us to hit our kids, they should n't either.'
Principal Jaime Handlin declined to comment, citing the on - going legislation, but she did tell the Willston Pioneer newspaper that 'nothing was violated.'
She added, 'I disciplined out of love, not anger.'
Concerns are rising in the American business community.
Increasingly, China (albeit not necessarily its government agencies) has been accused of many incidents of hacking and espionage against America's companies and public sector.
Intellectual property rights (IPR) are often ignored.
At the same time, Chinese investments in sensitive US industries continue to be of concern (e.g. in oil and high technology).
China's investment frenzy reminds many people of Japan in the 1980's, when high - speed rail links were extended to Japan's remotest corners.
Most rely on government subsidies to this day.
And, while the subsidies may improve the quality of life for ordinary people in some respects, they also detract from it by suppressing domestic consumption.
A more ‘ assertive 'US military posture, as called for by Romney, is likely to heighten Chinese fears of US ‘ containment', and bolster the position of the hawks in the Chinese civilian and military establishment who support further increases in military spending, possibly starting a regional arms race.
It is one of the most controversial methods of child discipline, but spanking in school -- usually with a wooden or fiberglass paddle -- is still allowed by law in 19 states.
The practice is most prevalent in the Midwest and South.
According to a report from the Juvenile Information Exchange, more than 28,500 students in Georgia were spanked in 2008, mostly in rural counties.
The number is much smaller in Florida -- around 3,600 last year -- but that's where the issue is getting new attention.
In the worst case, our dollars come back to buy American goods, services, or assets.
In the best case, our dollars do n't come back and we get useful goods virtually for free.
A trade deficit reflects the best case, while a trade surplus reflects the worst - but still good - case.
Mr. Acemoglu and Mr. Robinson's analytical framework helps to make sense of one of the seeming paradoxes of the past 12 months - the prosperous middle - class people who have taken to the streets in the Arab world, in India and in Russia to protest crony capitalism.
If you believe that economic growth today is a sufficient condition for long - term prosperity, these affluent agitators are puzzling.
That leads observers to search for softer grievances, like the quest for dignity.
The immediate risk is continuing stagnation, or recession, in Europe.
In the last decade, export growth has accounted for roughly one - third of China's overall economic growth, and about one - third of Chinese exports went to the European Union.
If the situation in Europe continues to deteriorate, China's growth will be dragged down.
International norms and soft power
There is a strong US perception that China, despite being a member of a number of international regimes including the World Trade Organization, G20 and UN Security Council, resists or disputes international norms.
The difference in priorities and values plays out in areas such as human rights (domestically in general and with regard to Tibet) and sovereignty.
China has focused in recent years on expanding its soft power through the creation of Confucius Institutes around the world, but so far its ideology has not proved itself globally attractive.
In other soft - power arenas such as education and the media, China still lags considerably behind the United States and other Western nations.
China's trajectory and its level of engagement with the international community are of global concern.
They will be significantly affected by its relationship with the United States: cooperation is likely to lead to a more positive Chinese role, while competition would result in Chinese intransigence and have implications for progress on global issues from the environment to space and cyber security as well as issues arising in the UN Security Council, to trade and development.
It would also put nations that are dependent on both the United States and China for economic and / or security reasons in a difficult position as they try to balance the two.
Making room for China's growth and participation will be important.
THE NOT - SO - GREAT WALL
Li acknowledges that China has problems, namely, slowing economic growth, the inadequate provision of social services, and corruption, but he claims that the CCP is more capable than any democratic government of fixing them.
The CCP, Li argues, will be able to make tough decisions and follow through on them thanks to the party's ability to self - correct, its meritocratic structure, and its vast reserves of popular legitimacy.
One problem is that Vietnamese have long been used to dealing in foreign currencies, and sometimes buy land and other expensive goods with gold instead of bank notes.
People here consume 10 times more gold on a per capita basis than people in China, according to data collected by the World Gold Council, and about twice as much as Indians.
While Vietnam Airlines stands out as a regional player, investors wonder whether other state - owned firms are in the position of Vinashin, Vietnam Shipbuilding Industry Group.
After walking through the positives of China's political system, Li moves on to the problems with the West's.
He sees all of the West's problems - a disintegrating middle class, broken infrastructure, indebtedness, politicians captured by special interests - as resulting from liberal democracy.
But such problems are not limited to liberal democratic governments.
Authoritarian regimes experience them, too.
Think of the economic turmoil that struck the juntas of Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s and Indonesia in 1997.
The only authoritarian governments that have historically managed to avoid financial crises were those with centrally planned economies that lacked financial systems to begin with.
Instead of sharp cyclical ups and downs, those types of economies produce long - term economic stagnation.
A Romney presidency
Mr. Acemoglu and Mr. Robinson are pretty tough on Western experts, officials and business people who, they say, are too easily seduced by the leaders of extractive regimes, particularly ones enjoying temporary bursts of prosperity.
Just watch the news and you'll see those in our government and in the media expressing predominantly mercantilist views: Our trading partners' currencies are too cheap and the trade deficit is too high - together, these two factors reduce domestic employment.
The November 2012 US presidential and congressional elections are occurring at a time of profound uncertainty inside and outside the United States.
How the next administration adapts to a host of international challenges will be central not only to America's prosperity and security, but also, given its continuing global economic and political power, to that of countries across the world.
The months before and after the elections will witness an enormous number of analyses and reports by US institutions and media on the future of foreign and domestic policy, targeted principally at US public and policy - making audiences.
Using its international reputation for informed and independent analysis, Chatham House's Programme on the US International Role assesses the likely trajectories of US international policy after the 2012 election from an external perspective, analysing the implications for other countries and helping them to understand how a new president and his policies will affect them.
A version of this view, which has gained particular currency since the collapse of the Soviet Union, is that the key is private property.
Establish property rights, the reformers in Warsaw, Moscow and Beijing believed, and economic and social success will inevitably follow.
By purchasing U.S. assets or services, the purchasers make individual Americans and American companies richer.
After all, in any exchange, both sides gain or else they would n't engage in the exchange.
Direct investment in plant and equipment increases the productivity and, therefore, the wages of American workers.
If these foreigners keep their dollars, then we get valuable cars and they get cheap pieces of paper that our government can print for pennies on the dollar.
If they exchange their dollars on international currency exchanges, then the person or entity they exchange with has the same invest / buy products / buy services / exchange / keep decision to make.
Yao Yang is Director of the China Center for Economic Research at Peking University.
"Too much attention has been given to the increase of investment rather than that of quality, productivity, efficiency and competitiveness," Tran Tien Cuong, of the Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM), was recently quoted as saying in the state Vietnam News.
Over the past two decades Vietnam has been among Asia's fastest - developing countries, with average annual growth of 7.1 percent between 1990 and 2009, according to the Asian Development Bank.
Vietnam's' tiger 'economy limping: investors
As I write these words, New Orleans is in chaos.
A number of oil refineries have been knocked out of commission by Hurricane Katrina.
Gas prices have spiked upward.
Politicians are threatening suppliers with legal action for "price gouging," raising prices at a time of crisis.
These politicians evidently believe that begging and lecturing citizens can perform the role that prices do in creating and sustaining order, an order where I never have to think twice or even once about whether gasoline will be available at the corner for my vacation or drive to work or to take an emergency trip to the hospital.
As a result, a majority of rural kids will enter the workforce without a university diploma , Among China's 140 million migrant workers, 80% have only nine years or less of formal education – far short of what high - income countries require
With one million young people entering the job market annually, the ruling party, concerned about maintaining its power, "is not in a position to close the door" on the foreigners' suggestions, he said.
We call these phenomena "markets. , It's an unfortunate term, but one of course, that I have no control over
It's the term that has been used for a century or more and is likely to endure.
But I say unfortunate, because in the mind of the public, the term "markets," conjures up either the New York Stock Exchange or a farmer's market, highly organized, centralized interactions between buyers and sellers.
Most of what we study in economics called markets are decentralizednon - organized interactions between buyers and sellers.
With a per capita income of about 1,200 dollars, the nation of 86 million people is now a "middle - income" country, according to World Bank criteria.
It is unlikely that a democratic China would beat today's China in GDP growth, but at least the growth would be more inclusive.
The benefits would flow not just to the government and to a small number of connected capitalists but to the majority of the Chinese population, because a well - functioning democracy advances the greatest good for the most possible.
For these reasons, it will be vital that any American administration makes every effort to engage in an open and transparent dialogue with the Chinese and ensure that US intentions are clear.
Ensuring such clarity and deliberation could do much to maintain relations on a positive trajectory or, at a minimum, ensure that they do not spiral out of control.
In this respect, the continuity of a second Obama administration that pursues a similar posture would be helpful, particularly as China goes through its own political transition.
To change completely the government's distorting behavior, however, requires more drastic political changes.
The hukou reform is a good start, as it will strengthen migrants' political rights in local communities.
Given their large numbers, their political participation may force local governments to become more responsive to ordinary people's needs.
And government responsiveness at lower levels, one may hope, might eventually trickle up to the top.
Do you have more dollars in your portfolio than yen or renminbi or euros?
I do.
Do n't you want your portfolio to increase in value?
I do.
Then why wish for the American dollar to decline in value?
Serious concerns have also emerged in recent months about the financial health of big state conglomerates.
"Most investors agree that Vietnam has huge potential," says Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce Vietnam (AmCham).
But Vietnam remains far from resembling Taiwan, Singapore or South Korea, whose fast growth earned them the label "Tiger" economies, and whose success it dreams of emulating.
The country "risks falling into the 'middle income trap', the inability to arise out of an economy based on cheap labour and low - technology manufacturing methods," said Matthias Duhn, executive director of Eurocham, the European Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam.
The warnings come just before a five - yearly Communist Party Congress, expected in mid-January.
Stock market analysts said equity prices here have retreated to a level at which they now look attractive, with only those in Pakistan rated cheaper on a price - to - earnings basis.
On Wednesday, the VN Index closed 0.8% higher at 493.47 points amid heavy trading volumes driven, brokers said, by speculation that the government's change in focus might help stabilize prices.
The United States has tried to improve its understanding of China and to encourage greater transparency on the Chinese side, not least in military matters.
During the February visit to America of Vice President Xi Jinping, Washington proposed stronger military - to - military engagement, but China is thus far unwilling to engage in substantive talks.
Ambiguity provides it with a deeper buffer zone in which uncertainty regarding Chinese ‘ red lines' makes America hesitant to act.
After extolling the CCP's adaptability, Li moves on to praising its meritocracy.
Here, he relates the story of Qiu He, who, thanks to his innovative public policies, rose from small - time apparatchik in a backward county to vice party secretary of Yunnan Province.
The fact that the Chinese political system is sufficiently flexible to have allowed someone like Qiu to experiment with reforms is one reason it has not crumbled sooner.
Nevertheless, it is odd that Li uses Qiu's story in his case against democracy.
The features of the Chinese political system that allowed Qiu to experiment with policy innovations, subsidiarity (the organizational principle that matters should be handled by the lowest authority capable of addressing them) and federalism, are actually the foundation of any well - functioning democracy.
Unlike in China, where the central government decrees subsidiarity and federalism, most democracies constitutionally enshrine the decentralization of political power.
Nothing to see here: protesting a chemical plant in Zhejiang Province, China, October 27, 2012.
Another of Li's claims is about the popular legitimacy of the CCP.
But corruption and abuse of power undermine that legitimacy.
This is one of the lessons party leaders have drawn from the Bo Xilai affair.
Remarkably, both Hu Jintao, the outgoing president, and Xi Jinping, the incoming one, have recently issued dire warnings that corruption could lead to the collapse of the party and the state.
They are right, especially in light of China's ongoing economic slowdown.
That is not to say that some individual CCP leaders are not still widely respected by the Chinese population.
But these officials tend to have been the reformers of the party, such as Deng Xiaoping, who initiated China's market reforms beginning in the late 1970s, and Hu Yaobang, who was general secretary of the CCP during Deng's leadership.
The fact that such reformers remain popular today provides the CCP with an opportunity: it could pursue a proactive reform agenda to achieve a gradual and peaceful transition to democracy, avoiding the chaos and upheavals that are engulfing the Middle East.
But the key would be to start those reforms now.

In the security and geopolitical arena, Romney has called for a more active or assertive American security and foreign policy posture, with increased funding for the military.
If implemented, this could have significant repercussions on the bilateral relationship.
There has been little mention by Romney of such potential flash - points as Taiwan.
Finally, Romney has suggested that he would focus more attention on China's actions in international institutions and its support for international norms, particularly in human rights.
Given his strong religious background, this is likely to be an issue of particular personal concern, but it is unclear whether it would manifest itself as a priority for him in this relationship.
When I made this point to a student he countered by asking why Wal - Mart has a right to exploit low - skilled workers who have such limited alternatives.
But the 2008 Foreign Affairs essay highlights a very important exception.
One of the authors of this devastating critique of Putinism was Michael A. McFaul, the new U.S. ambassador in Moscow.
That appointment, lauded by many inside and outside Russia for utilizing the skills of an acknowledged Russia expert, may be one reason to be hopeful about Russia today.
The hopes and promises of the early 1990s, when the communist nation abandoned a planned economy for the laws of the market, have not been realised.
But the Communist - run government's determination to hit persistently high growth targets, coupled with state - directed lending growth of more than 30% annually in recent years, have flooded Vietnam's economy with money and created a raft of problems for the local currency.
The excess capital has triggered a sharper uptick in inflation than has been seen in other emerging markets, stripping confidence in the dong as residents doubt their government can manage rising costs in the months ahead.
Li cites Transparency International data to argue that many democracies are more corrupt than China.
Putting aside the irony of using data from an organization committed to transparency to defend an opaque authoritarian system, Li's argument reveals a deeper analytic point.
Uncovering corruption requires information.
In a one - party system, real information is suppressed and scarce.
The Indian Web site I Paid a Bribe was set up in 2010 as a way for Indians to post anonymously to report incidents of having needed to pay someone off to get a government service.
As of November 2012, the Web site had recorded more than 21,000 reports of corruption.
Yet when Chinese netizens tried to set up similar sites, such as I Made a Bribe and www.522phone.com, the government shut them down.
It would therefore be useless to compare India's 21,000 reported incidents with China's zero and conclude that India is more corrupt.
Yet that is essentially what Li did.
For the second year in a row, a Florida lawmaker is trying to ban corporal punishment in schools there; last year the measure never made it to the floor for a full vote.
To be sure, democratization is in the CCP's hands.
But on that score, too, things are getting better.
Even some of China's establishment figures have come to believe that stability comes not from repression but from greater political and economic openness.
On the eve of the 18th Party Congress, which was held in November, an open letter calling for more transparency and more intraparty democracy swirled around the Internet.
One of the letter's authors was Chen Xiaolu, the youngest son of one of the most decorated marshals of the Chinese army, who was also a former vice premier and foreign minister and a trusted aid to former Premier Zhou Enlai.
Chen and many other Chinese elites no longer believe the status quo is viable.
The Communist Party Congress in January might determine how far Mr. Dung and other leaders are willing to go - and even whether they survive to push through policy changes.
The congress, held every five years, will determine whether Mr. Dung will be appointed to a second term as premier and will likely set the scope of any reform plan.
Over-tightening of domestic macroeconomic policies, especially those aimed at the real - estate market, could heighten the risk of a slowdown, with house prices currently falling across China, owing to stringent government measures.
Indeed, the situation is much like that of the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
In the several years before that crisis hit, China had been combating inflation, and appeared to be headed for a soft landing.
But the combination of crisis and austerity condemned China to several years of deflation and considerably slower growth.
Rising military capabilities
With the exception of 2006, Chinese defence spending has increased by double digits every year since 1989 according to official figures (although most analysts estimate spending to be notably higher).
China's focus on building naval offshore capacity, allowing it to operate well beyond its borders, suggests a desire to extend its reach.
Its investment in offensive weapons, not least those targeting Taiwan, is also of particular concern to the United States (as well as to other countries in the region).
A crucial argument Mr. Acemoglu and Mr. Robinson make - and one foreign aid donors and policy advisers too often miss - is that the leaders of extractive regimes do n't implement policies that stifle sustainable growth out of ignorance.
They are n't stupid; they are merely and rationally pursuing their own self - interest.
The real ignorance is that of outsiders who fail to appreciate that in an extractive regime, the interests of the rulers and the ruled do not coincide.
"Russia is ruled by a narrow clique," Mr. Acemoglu said.
The only thing that is keeping it going is a big boom in natural resources and a clever handling of the media.
And that is a good thing.
Li is right that China has made huge economic and social gains in the past few decades.
But it has also proved ineffective at creating inclusive growth, reducing income inequality, culling graft, and containing environmental damage.
As the scholars David Lake and Matthew Baum have shown, democracies simply do a better job than authoritarian governments at providing public services.
And countries that make the transition to democracy experience an immediate improvement.
Already, China is seeing some of these effects: Nancy Qian, an economist at Yale University, has shown that the introduction of village elections in China has improved accountability and increased expenditures on public services.
Friedrich A. Hayek, in The Fatal Conceit, wrote that "The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design. Unfortunately, when politicians try to dial down prices to preserve order, they only worsen the problem
We would do well to remember the emergent nature of prices, especially in times of crisis.
Infrastructure investment will inevitably run up against the law of diminishing marginal returns, but consumption growth does not have a limit.
Suppressing consumption thus suffocates future growth, and the share of household consumption in GDP has declined from 67% in the mid-1990's to below 50% in recent years, with most of the decline reflecting the distortions created by government policies.
Placing priority, and potentially raising tensions, in the economic area, as Romney might do, could have two principal worldwide impacts.
First, it could result in retaliatory actions by China in the economic sphere, such as reversing its current relatively cooperative attitude by stopping currency flexibility, freezing progress on further international integration in the financial arena, or raising trade barriers or tariffs.
Second, it could motivate China to continue to reduce its interdependence with the United States, investing more in Europe and other regions, and embracing more closely the commercial relationships that form the basis of its engagement with many European countries.
Most of Vietnam's neighbors, including Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea, are seeing their currencies shoot up in value as investors bet on stronger growth in Asian markets while the U.S. and Europe slog through slow recoveries from the latest global recession, sending the dollar and the euro lower.
Even if parents do not agree with corporal punishment, there is little they can do, if a school district permits it, to guarantee that their child will not be hit by an administrator if she or he misbehaves.
Sendek says her group suggests that parents who want to opt out of that type of discipline should send a letter to the principal and school administrators at the beginning of each school year, and make sure that their concerns are put in the child's permanent record.
She also recommends reviewing the school district's disciplinary policies and voicing any concerns at parent / teacher conferences or school board meetings before a child is ever hit.
Eurocham cites estimates that Vietnam needs around 70 to 80 billion dollars of investment in road, rail and seaport infrastructure in the next five to 10 years.
Modern mercantilists are saying that American consumers should suffer higher prices due to tariffs, import restrictions, and currency devaluations to support and protect American manufacturers, who can then hire workers, export goods, and bring in hard currency.
Modern economists reply that this is a way to make a nation poorer, not richer.
The way to make the nation wealthy is to keep the currency stable and allow domestic and international trade to flourish.
In doing so, we allow individuals and individual geographical areas to specialize and discover their comparative advantage - that area of production in which we are most productive and most efficiently create what others want.
There are concerns on both sides regarding potentially conflicting geopolitical and, in particular, regional interests.
China senses that the United States might be pursuing a strategy of containment, while from the American perspective China is implementing an Anti-Access and Area Denial (A2 / AD) regional policy against the United States.
Flash - points could arise over territorial or other disputes in the region between China and American friends and allies, in particular over Taiwan where the United States is committed to preventing unilateral efforts to alter the status quo.
In 2011, standing in front of the Royal Society (the British academy of sciences), Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao declared, "Tomorrow's China will be a country that fully achieves democracy, the rule of law, fairness, and justice.
Without freedom, there is no real democracy.
Without guarantee of economic and political rights, there is no real freedom. "
Eric Li's article in these pages, "The Life of the Party," pays no such lip service to democracy.
Instead, Li, a Shanghai - based venture capitalist, declares that the debate over Chinese democratization is dead: the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will not only stay in power; its success in the coming years will "consolidate the one - party model and, in the process, challenge the West's conventional wisdom about political development.", Li might have called the race too soon
China's government is production - oriented by nature.
The upside is that this has helped to maintain high GDP growth rates.
But the downside is equally pronounced.
One negative consequence is the persistent deepening of income inequality.
The Gini coefficient of per capita income has surpassed 50 (with 100 representing maximal inequality), putting China in the upper quartile of inequality worldwide.
The company has been driven to the brink of bankruptcy with debts of at least 86 trillion dong (4.4 billion dollars).
In the early Putin era, the Acemoglu and Robinson approach was very much a minority view.
As recently as 2008, an essay in Foreign Affairs magazine by a pair of influential Western scholars laid out the 'conventional explanation for Vladimir Putin's popularity' thus: 'Since 2000, under Putin, order has returned, the economy has flourished, and the average Russian is living better than ever before.'
As political freedom has decreased, economic growth has increased.
Putin may have rolled back democratic gains, the story goes, but these were necessary sacrifices on the altar of stability and growth.
DEMOCRACY IS COMING
Even as Li argues that the CCP's one - party system is the best China can get, he also lays out some sensible reforms for improving it.
He proposes stronger nongovernmental organizations, which would help the government deliver better services; more independent media, which would help check corruption; and elements of so - called intraparty democracy, which would help air the party's "dirty laundry and discourage unseemly behavior.", He is right
Ironically, these are all core components of a well - functioning democracy.
"It's worth it for the peace of mind," Ms. Phuong says.
This loss of faith in the dong also presents a challenge for Vietnam's Communist leaders who, until now, have relied on rapid economic growth to keep the country's 85 million people satisfied.
As the dong weakens, it is driving up the cost of imported goods and ratcheting up fears of higher inflation rates to come.
The consumer - price index hit 11.1% in November, virtually assuring that the full - year inflation rate will hit double figures.
Economic growth overall is expected to reach 6.7%.
Governor Romney's campaign rhetoric on China has focused largely on economic issues, with less attention devoted to the military, geopolitical or soft power of China except in the context of his broader vision of the world and the United States.
Given his focus and experience on economic and trade issues (broadly defined), as president his China priorities are likely to remain in these areas.
However, the breadth of the interactions and interests between the two countries will inevitably lead to a broader policy platform that includes the other diverse elements of the bilateral relationship.
No country can adopt such foundational elements of democracy without eventually adopting the whole thing.
It would be impossible to sustain vibrant primary elections or caucuses, such as that in Iowa, but have a central government that ruled like Stalin.
Consider Taiwan, where democracy evolved over time.
In the early 1970s, Chiang Ching - kuo, who was to become president in 1978, began to reform the ruling party, the Kuomintang, in order to allow local competitive elections, indigenous Taiwanese participation (before, only those living in mainland China had been allowed to stand for important positions), and public scrutiny of the party's budget process.
He also released political prisoners and became more tolerant of the press and nongovernmental organizations.
When an opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party, sprang up in 1986, it was a natural outgrowth of Chiang's earlier reforms.
For Taiwan, it was eventually impossible to draw a line between some democracy and full democracy.
The same will be true for China.
In the context of the current US - Chinese relationship, this paper lays out the likely China policy of either a second - term Barack Obama administration or an incoming Mitt Romney's administration, and the international implications of these two alternatives.
Government economists also estimate that as much as $5 billion in U.S. bank notes are held outside the banking system in Vietnam, stuffed into mattresses or hidden under creaky floorboards - enough to cover Vietnam's projected balance - of - payments deficit this year.
Stronger currencies are a problem for many Asian countries because they make those countries' export sectors less competitive on global markets.
